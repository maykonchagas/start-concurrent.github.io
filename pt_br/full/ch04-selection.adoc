=== Problem: Monty Hall simulation

There's a famous mathematical puzzle called the Monty Hall problem,
based on the television show _Let's Make a Deal_ hosted by the eponymous
Monty Hall. In this problem, you're presented with three doors. Two of
the three doors have junk behind them. One randomly selected door
conceals something like a pile of gold. If you can choose that door, you
win the gold. After you make an initial choice, Monty, who knows which
door the pile of gold is behind, will open one of the two other doors,
always picking a door with junk behind it. If you chose the gold door,
Monty will pick between the two junk doors randomly. After opening a
door, Monty gives you a chance to switch to the other unopened door. You
decide to switch or not, the appropriate door is opened, and you win
either junk or a pile of gold, depending on your luck.

As it turns out, it's always a better strategy to switch doors. If you
keep your initial choice, you have a 1 in 3 chance to win the gold.
However, if you switch doors, you'll have a 2 in 3 chance. The problem is
counterintuitive and leads many people, including mathematicians and
people holding advanced degrees, to the incorrect answer.

Think about it this way: Suppose you could pick two doors to open, and
if the gold was behind either one of them, you'd win. Clearly, you'd have a 2
in 3 chance of winning. Monty allows you this option. Just pick the two
doors you want and tell Monty the third. He reveals one of your two initial
doors as junk, and you switch to the other one.

If you still aren't convinced, that's fine. Your goal is to write a
program that simulates the Monty Hall dilemma, allowing a user to guess
a door and then potentially switch. Once you've written the
simulation, you can choose to play repeatedly and see how well you do if
you switch.

A Monty Hall scenario has two significant features that distinguish it
from problems in previous chapters. First, randomness play a role.
Generating random numbers has become an important part of computer
science, and most languages provide programmers with tools for
generating random or practically random numbers. Recall the `Random` class
from <<ch03-strings-primitive-types#ch03-strings-primitive-types>>. With an object of
type `Random` called `random`, you can generate a random `int` between
`0` and `n - 1` by calling `random.nextInt(n)`.

The second and much more important feature of Java in the solution to
this problem is the element of choice. A random door is chosen to hide
gold, and the program must react appropriately. The user chooses a door,
and the program must carefully choose another door to open in response.
Finally, the user must decide whether or not he or she wants to switch
his or her choice. Inherent in this problem is the idea of _conditional
execution_. Every program from the previous chapter runs sequentially,
line by line. With conditional execution, only some of the code may be
executed, depending on input from the user or the values that random
numbers take. Previously, every program was deterministic, a series of
inevitable consequences. Now, that linear, one-thing-follows-another
paradigm has split into complex trees and webs of possible program
executions.

=== Concepts: Choosing between options

Before we get to random numbers and the complex choices involved in the
Monty Hall problem, let's talk about the simplified approach that most
programming languages take to conditional execution. When we come to a
point in a program where there is a choice to be made, we can think of
it as the question, "`Do I want to perform this series of tasks?`" Like
the classic game of 20 Questions, these questions in Java generally only
have two answers: "`yes`" or "`no.`" If the answer is "`yes,`" the
program completes Task A, otherwise it completes Task B. It's easier to
design programming languages that can handle yes-or-no questions than
any general question. If you've studied logic in the past, you have
probably run across _Boolean logic_. Boolean logic gives a set of rules,
similar to the rules of traditional algebra, that can be applied to a
system with only two values: true and false.

==== Simple choices

Because we want to build a system using only yes-or-no questions,
Boolean logic is a perfect fit for computer science. To conform with
other computer scientists, we try to think of conditions in terms of
true and false, instead of yes and no. Thus, we can begin to formulate
the kinds of choices we want to make:

====
_If it's raining outside,_
=====
_I'll take my umbrella._
=====
====


This statement is a very simple program, even though it's not one
executed by a computer. The person following this program asks herself,
"`Is it raining today?`" If the answer is "`yes,`" then she'll take
her umbrella. We can abstract this idea a bit further by saying that
_raining outside_ is a condition _p_ and that _taking my
umbrella_ is an action _a_. In other words, if
_p_ is true, then do _a_. We haven't specified
what is to be done if _p_ is not true, although we can 
assume that the actor in this drama will *not* take an umbrella.

If we want to view _p_ as a decision to make, we can specify
what happens if it's not true. For example, we could formulate another
choice:

====
_If I have at least $50 in my pocket,_
=====
_I'll eat a lobster dinner;_
=====
_otherwise,_
=====
_I'll eat fast food._
=====
====

In this case, we let _having at least $50_ be condition _q_,
_eating a lobster dinner_ be action _b_, and _eating fast
food_ be action _c_. Now we've created a decision. If
_q_ is true, the person will do action _b_, but
if it's false, she'll do action _c_.

==== Boolean operations

Even by itself, the ability to pick between two options is powerful, but
we can augment this ability in a couple of ways. First, we don't have to
rely on simple conditions. Using Boolean logic, we can make arbitrarily
complex conditions.

====
_If I'm bored, or it's late and I can't sleep,_
=====
_I'll watch television._
=====
====

Someone following this program will watch television if he's bored or
if it's late and he also can't sleep. We can break the condition into
three sub-conditions: _I'm bored_ is condition _x_, _it's
late_ is condition _y_, and _I can't sleep_ is condition
_z_. We have connected these three conditions together using
the words "`and`" and "`or.`" These two simple words represent powerful
concepts in Boolean logic, AND and OR. When two conditions are combined
with AND, the result is true only if both conditions are true. When two
conditions are combined with OR, the result is true if either of the
conditions is true.

We can create a table called a _truth table_ to show all the possible
values certain conditions can take. We're going to use the symbol
∧ to represent the concept of AND and the symbol
∨ to represent the concept of OR. We'll also
abbreviate true to T and false to F.

Given a condition _x_, a condition _y_, and the condition made by _x_ ∧ _y_,
this truth table shows all possible values. As stipulated, _x_ ∧ _y_ is true only when both _x_ and _y_ are true.

[.center%autowidth,cols="^,^,^",options="header",]
|=========================================================
|_x_ |_y_ |_x_ ∧ _y_
|T |T |T
|T |F |F
|F |T |F
|F |F |F
|=========================================================

This truth table gives all the values for _x_ ∨ _y_. As you can see, _x_ ∨ _y_ is true if _x_ or _y_ are true.

[.center%autowidth,cols="^,^,^",options="header",]
|========================================================
|_x_ |_y_ |_x_ ∨ _y_
|T |T |T
|T |F |T
|F |T |T
|F |F |F
|========================================================

There's confusion surrounding the word "`or`" in English.
Sometimes "`or`" is used in an exclusive sense to mean one or the other
but not both, as in, "`Would you like lemonade or iced tea with your
meal?`" In logic, this exclusive or exists as well and is called XOR.
This difference gives another reason for a formally structured language
like mathematics or Java to express ourselves precisely. When two
conditions are connected with XOR, the result is true if one or the
other but not both conditions are true. We use the symbol
⊕ to represent the XOR operation in the truth table
below.

This truth table gives all the values for _x_ ⊕ _y_.

[.text-center]
[.center%autowidth,cols="^,^,^",options="header",]
|==========================================================
|_x_ |_y_ |_x_ ⊕ _y_
|T |T |F
|T |F |T
|F |T |T
|F |F |F
|==========================================================

The operations AND, OR, and XOR are all binary operations like addition
and multiplication. They connect two conditions together to get a
result. There's also a single unary operation in Boolean logic, the NOT
operator. A NOT simply reverses a condition. If a condition is true,
then NOT applied to that condition will yield false, and vice versa.

Here's a truth table for NOT, using the symbol ¬ to represent the NOT operation.

[.text-center]
[.center%autowidth,cols="^,^",options="header",]
|======================================
|_x_ |¬__x__
|T |F
|F |T
|======================================

Now that we've nailed down some notation for Boolean logic, we can
express the complicated expression that sent us down this path in the
first place. Recall that _x_ is _I'm bored_,
_y_ is _it's late_, and _z_ is _I can't sleep_.
Let _d_ be the action _I'll watch television_. We can
express the choice in this way: If _x_ ∨ (_y_ ∧ _z_),
then do _d_. Using this notation, we've expressed
precisely the conditions for watching television, using parentheses to
clear up the ambiguity present in the original statement. If we can map
individual conditions to Boolean variables, we can build conditions of
arbitrary complexity.

==== Nested choices

Making one choice is all well and good, but in life and computer
programs, we may have to make many interrelated choices. For example, if
you choose to eat at a seafood restaurant, then you might choose between
eating shrimp and lobster, but if you choose instead to eat at a
steakhouse, the options of shrimp and lobster might not be available.

A _nested_ choice is one that sits inside of another choice you've
already made. We could describe choices of restaurants and meals as
follows.

====
_If I want seafood,_
=====
_I'll eat at Sharky's, where_
======
_if I have at least $50,_
=======
_I'll order the lobster;_
=======
_otherwise,_ 
=======
_I'll order the shrimp._
=======
======
=====
_But if I don't want seafood,_
=====
_I'll eat at the Golden Calf, where_
======
_if I have at least $30,_
=======
_I'll order the filet mignon;_
=======
_otherwise,_ 
=======
_I'll order the pork chops._
=======
======
=====
====


The previous description is long, but it precisely expresses the
decisions our imaginary diner might make. This description in English
has drawbacks: It's long and repetitive, and the grouping of specific
meal choices with specific restaurants isn't clear.

In the next section, we discuss Java syntax that allows us to
express the same sorts of decision patterns. Unlike English, Java has
been designed to make these sequences of decisions clear and easy to
read.

=== Syntax: Selection in Java

With some theoretical background on the kinds of choices we're
interested in making, we can now discuss the Java syntax used to
describe these choices. It was no accident that we kept repeating the
word "`if,`" because the main Java language feature for making choices
is called an `if` statement.

==== `if` statements

The designers of Java studied Boolean logic and created a type called
`boolean`. Every condition used by an `if` statement must evaluate to a
`boolean` value, which can only be one of two things: `true` or `false`.

For example, we could have a `boolean` variable called `raining`. Stored
in this variable is the value `true` if it's raining and `false` if it
isn't. Using Java syntax, we could encode our first example in which our
actor takes her umbrella when it's raining.

[source,java]
----
if(raining) {
    umbrella.take();
}
----

The action taken if it is raining is done by calling a _method_ on an
_object_. We'll discuss objects and methods further in
<<ch08-methods#ch08-methods>> and <<ch09-classes#ch09-classes>>. What we're
focusing on now is that the line `umbrella.take();` is executed *only* if
`raining` has the value `true`. Nothing is done if it's `false`.
<<figure-if>> shows this pattern of conditional execution
followed by all `if` statements.

[[figure-if]]
[.text-center]
.Execution goes inside the `if` statement when its condition is `true` and skips past it otherwise.
image::if.svg[scaledwidth=50%,pdfwidth=50%,width=50%]


Our descriptions of logical scenarios from the previous section used the
word "`then`" to mark the actions that would be done if a condition was
true. Some languages use `then` as a keyword, but Java doesn't.
Instead, note the left brace (`{`) and the right brace (`}`) that
enclose the executable line `umbrella.take();`. These braces serve the
same role as the word "`then,`" clearly marking the action to be
performed if a condition is true. Braces are unambiguous because they
mark a start and an end. If there are many actions to be done, they can
all be put inside the braces, and there will be no question as to which
actions are associated with a given `if` statement.

For example, we may also need to close the window and put on a raincoat
if it's raining. We might accomplish these tasks in Java as follows.

[source,java]
----
if(raining) {
    umbrella.take();
    window.close();
    raincoat.putOn();
}
----

Within a matching pair of braces (`{ }`), called a _block_ of code,
execution proceeds normally, line by line. First, the JVM will cause the
umbrella to be taken, then the window to be closed, and finally the
raincoat to be put on.

If only a single line of code is contained within a block of code, the
braces can be left out. For example, many experienced Java programmers
would have written our first example as follows.

[source,java]
----
if(raining)
    umbrella.take();
----

For beginning Java programmers, however, it's a good idea to use braces
even when you don't need to. Without braces, code can appear to be doing
one thing when it's really doing another.

Since programmers must often choose between two alternatives, Java
provides an `else` statement to specify code that should be run when the
condition of the `if` statement is false.

Let `fiftyDollars` be a `boolean` variable that's `true` if we have at
least $50 and is `false` otherwise. Now, we can choose between two
dining options based on how much money we have.

[source,java]
----
if(fiftyDollars) {
    lobsterDinner.eat();
}
else {
    fastFood.eat();
}
----

This Java code matches the logical statements we wrote before. If we
have enough money, we'll eat a lobster dinner; otherwise, we'll eat fast
food. As with an `if` statement, we use braces to mark a block of code
for an `else` statement, too. Since a single line of code will be
executed in each case, the braces are optional here. We could have
written code with the same functionality as follows.

[source,java]
----
if(fiftyDollars)
    lobsterDinner.eat();
else
    fastFood.eat();
----

<<figure-else>> shows the pattern of conditional execution
followed by all `if` statements that have a matching `else` statement.

[[figure-else]]
[.text-center]
.Execution goes inside the `if` statement when its condition is `true` and jumps into the `else` statement otherwise.
image::else.svg[scaledwidth=50%,pdfwidth=50%,width=50%]


.Pitfall: Misleading indentation
[WARNING]
====

Indentation is used to make code more readable, but Java ignores
whitespace, meaning that the indentation has no effect on the execution
of the code. To demonstrate, let's assume that our imaginary diner knows
he'll get a stomachache after eating fast food. Thus, he'll take
some Pepto-Bismol after eating it. If you added this action to the code above, which
does not contain braces, you might get the following.

[source,java]
----
if(fiftyDollars)
    lobsterDinner.eat();
else
    fastFood.eat();
    peptoBismol.take();
----

Although it looks like both `fastFood.eat();` and `peptoBismol.take();`
are within the block of the `else` statement, only `fastFood.eat();` is.
The line `peptoBismol.take();` is not part of the `if`-`else` structure
at all and will be executed no matter what. The correct way to program
this decision is below.

[source,java]
----
if(fiftyDollars)
    lobsterDinner.eat();
else {
    fastFood.eat();
    peptoBismol.take();
}
----

====

==== The `boolean` type and its operations

Recall that Java uses the type `boolean` for values that can only be
true or false. Just like the numerical types `double` and `int`, the
`boolean` type has specific operations that can be used to combine them
together. By design, these operations correspond exactly to the logical
operations we described before. Here's a table giving the Java
operators equivalent to the logical Boolean operations.

[.center%autowidth,cols="^.^,^.^,^.^,<.^",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
^.>|Name
^.>|Math +
Symbol
^.>|Java +
Operator
<.>|Description
|AND |∧ |`&&` |Returns `true` if both values are `true`
|OR |∨ |`\|\|` |Returns `true` if either value is `true`
|XOR |⊕ |`^` |Returns `true` if values are different
|NOT |¬ |`!` |Returns the opposite of the value
|=======================================================================

Using these operators, we can create `boolean` values and combine them
together.

[source,java]
----
boolean x = true;
boolean y = false;
boolean z = !((x || y) ^ (x && y));
----

When this code is executed, the value of `z` will be `false`. Although
it's perfectly legal to perform `boolean` operations this way, it's
much more common to combine them "`on the fly`" inside of the condition
of an `if` statement. Recall the statement from the previous section:

====
_If I'm bored, or it's late and I can't sleep,_
=====
_I'll watch television._
=====
====

If we let `bored`, `late`, and `canSleep` be `boolean` variables whose
values indicate if we are bored, if it is late, and if we can sleep,
respectively, we can encode this statement in Java like so.

[source,java]
----
if(bored || (late && !canSleep))
    television.watch();
----

Combining the `||` operator with other `||` operators is both
commutative and associative: order and grouping doesn't matter.
Likewise, combining the `&&` operator with other `&&` operators is
also commutative and associative. However, once you start mixing `||`
with `&&`, it's a good idea to use parentheses for grouping. If, in
the above example, `bored` is `true`, `late` is `false`, and `canSleep`
is `true`, then the expression `bored || (late && !canSleep)` will be
`true`. However, with the same values, the expression
`bored || late && !canSleep` will be `false`.

Now that we're discussing ordering, note that `||`
and `&&` are _short circuit_ operators. Short circuit means that, if
the value of the expression can be determined without evaluating the
rest of it, the JVM won't bother to compute any more of the
expression. With `||` this situation arises because `true` OR anything
else is still `true`. With `&&` this situations arises because `false`
AND anything else is still `false`.

[source,java]
----
if(true || ((late && !canSleep && isTired && isHungry) ||
    (wantsToFindOutWhatHappensNextInHisFavoriteShow ||
    likesTV)))
----

The condition of this `if` statement will always evaluate to `true`, and
its body will always be executed. Because Java knows this, it won't
even bother to check any of the conditions after the first `||` operator.
This short circuit evaluation is done at run time and will work if the
value of a variable at the beginning of an OR clause is `true`. It need
not be the literal `true`.

[source,java]
----
if(false && ((late || !canSleep || isTired || isHungry) &&
    (wantsToFindOutWhatHappensNextInHisFavoriteShow ||
    likesTV)))
----

The condition of this `if` statement will always evaluate to `false` and
its body won't be executed. As before, nothing after the first `&&`
will even be checked. If you're combining literals and `boolean`
values with the `||` and `&&` operators, it makes no difference that
short circuit evaluation occurs. However, if a method call is part of
the clauses, your code might miss valuable side-effects. For example,
let the `boolean` variable `working` be `false` in the following.

[source,java]
----
if(working && doSomethingImportant())
----

In this case, the `doSomethingImportant()` method must return a
`boolean` value to be a valid statement. Still, if `working` is `false`,
the `doSomethingImportant()` method won't even be called. As soon as the
JVM realizes that it's applying the `&&` operation to a `false`
value (or an `||` to a `true`), it'll give up. In many cases, doing so is fine. In fact,
programmers sometimes exploit this feature to allow code in a
method like `doSomethingImportant()` to run only if it's safe to do so.
In this case, if we assume that we always want to run the
`doSomethingImportant()` method (because it does something important)
every time the condition of the `if` statement is evaluated, we need to
restructure the code. For example, we can reverse the order of the two
terms in the AND clause to achieve this effect. Alternatively, Java
provides non-short circuit versions of the `||` and `&&` operators,
namely `|` and `&`, if you need to force full evaluation.

You might have been wondering where the majority of `boolean` values come
from. Most computer programs don't ask the user a long series of true
or false questions before spitting out an answer. Most `boolean` values
in Java programs are the result of comparisons, often of numerical data
types.

It's can be useful to compare two numbers to see if one is larger, smaller, or
equal to the other. For example, you might have a `double` variable
called `pressure` that gives the water pressure in a hydraulic system.
Perhaps you also have a constant called `CRITICAL_PRESSURE` that gives
the maximum safe pressure for your system. You can compare these values
using the `>` operator.

[source,java]
----
if(pressure > CRITICAL_PRESSURE)
    emergencyShutdown();
----

This code allows you to call the appropriate emergency method when
`pressure` is too high. Of course, the `>` operator is not the only way
to compare two values in Java. We list all the relational operators in
<<ch03-strings-primitive-types#ch03-strings-primitive-types>>, but
the table below shows them again in a
mathematical context.

[.center%autowidth,cols="<.^,^.^,^.^,<.^",options="header",]
.Relational operators
|=======================================================================
<.>|Name
^.>|Math +
Symbol
^.>|Java +
Operator

|Equals |= |`==` |`true` if the two values are equal
|Not Equals |≠ |`!=` |`true` if the two values are not

less than the second
|Less Than or Equals |≤ |`\<=` |`true` if the first

|Greater Than |> |`>` |`true` if the first value is
strictly greater than the second
|Greater Than or Equals |≥ |`>=` |`true` if the first
value is greater than or equal to the second
|=======================================================================

The concepts and mathematical symbols for these operators should be
familiar from mathematics. There are a few differences from the
mathematical versions of these ideas that are worth pointing out. First,
only easy-to-type symbols are used for Java operators. Thus, we need two
characters to represent most relational operators in the language. These operators
can be used to compare any numerical type with any other numerical type,
including `char`. In the case of mismatched types, such as an `int` and
a `double`, the lower precision type is automatically cast to the higher
precision type. Care should be taken when using the `==` operator with
floating-point types because of rounding errors. For example, the
expression `1.0/3.0 == 0.3333333333` always evaluates to `false`.

The `==` operator is not the same as the `=` operator from previous
chapters. In Java, the double equal sign `==` is used to compare two
things while the single equal sign `=` is used to assign one thing to
another.

Confusion can also arise because, in the mathematical world, relational
symbols are used to make a statement: _x_ < _y_ is an
announcement or a discovery that the value contained in _x_
is, in fact, smaller than the value contained in _y_. In the
Java world, the statement `x < y` is a *test* whose answer is `true` if
the value contained in `x` is smaller than the value contained in `y`
and `false` otherwise. Using these operators means performing a test at
a specific point in the code, asking a question about the values that
certain variables or literals (or the results of method calls) have at
that moment in time. In another sense, using these comparisons is a way
to take numerical data and convert it into the language of `boolean`
values. Note that the following statement does not compile in Java.

[source,java]
----
if(4)
    x = y + z;
----

To be used in an `if` statement, the value `4` must be first compared
with some other numerical type to yield a `true` or `false`. +

.Pitfall: Assignment instead of equality
[WARNING]
====

A common pitfall is to forget one of the equal signs
in the comparison operator.

[source,java]
----
if(x = 4)
    x = y + z;
----

Again, this code won't compile. If it did, the variable `x` would be
assigned the value `4`, which would in turn be given to the `if`
statement, but an `if` statement doesn't know what to do with anything
other than a `boolean` value.

Extreme care should be taken when
comparing two `boolean` values. For example, we might have two `boolean`
values `likesDogs1` and `likesDogs2`, corresponding to whether or not two
different people like dogs. Let's say that the value of each one is `true` if the
person likes dogs and `false` otherwise. We could create an `if`
statement that would work only if their values are the same.

[source,java]
----
if(likesDogs1 == likesDogs2)
    makeRoommates();
----

This code correctly calls the `makeRoommates()` method only if the two
individuals feel the same way about dogs. It doesn't matter if they both like
or dislike dogs, but one roommate loving dogs and the other hating dogs will lead to trouble. 
However, a tiny mistake in the code could yield the following.

[source,java]
----
if(likesDogs1 = likesDogs2)
    makeRoommates();
----

In this case, `likesDogs1` would be assigned to whatever `likesDogs2` is.
Then, that value would be given to the `if` statement. Here, the `makeRoommates()` method will be called only if `likesDogs2`
is `true`, meaning that the second person likes dogs. Thus, the two people will become roommates if
the second one likes dogs, and the feelings of the first person won't be
considered. Unlike the `x = 4` example, this code will compile with no warning.

====

The next few examples illustrate the use of the `if` statement. They
also use some methods from class `Math`.


[[leapYearExample]]
.Leap year
====

In the standard Gregorian calendar, leap years occur roughly once every
four years. During leap years, the month of February has 29 days instead
of 28. This extra day makes up for the fact that it takes a little more than 365.24
days for the earth to orbit the sun. Unfortunately, the orbit of the
earth around the sun doesn't match up in any exact way with the
rotation of the earth, making exceptions to the rule of every
four years.

In fact, the official definition for a leap year is a year that is
evenly divisible by 4, except for those years that are evenly divisible
by 100, with the exception to the exception of years that are evenly
divisible by 400. For example, 1988 was a leap year because it was
divisible by 4. The year 1900 was not a leap year because it was
divisible by 100 but not by 400, and the year 2000 was a leap year
because it was divisible by 400.

Recall that the mod operator (`%`) allows us to find the remainder
after integer division. Thus, if `n % 100` gives zero, `n` has no
remainder after being divided by `100` and must be evenly divisible by
100.

As with all of the programs in this section, we begin by importing
`java.util.*`, which is needed for the `Scanner` class for input. The
program prompts the user for a year and reads it in. If the year is
evenly divisible by 400, the program outputs that it's a leap year.
Otherwise, if the year is evenly divisible by 100, the program outputs
that it is not a leap year. Otherwise, if the year is evenly divisible
by 4, the program outputs that it's a leap year. Finally, if all the
other conditions have failed, the program outputs that the year is not a
leap year.

.Quadratic formula
====

The quadratic formula is a useful tool from mathematics. Using this
formula, you can solve equations of the form _ax_^2^ + _bx_
+ _c_ = 0. You might recall the statement of the quadratic formula given below.

//[stem]
//++++
//\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
//++++

[.text-center]
image::quadratic.svg[scaledwidth=20%,pdfwidth=20%,width=20%]

The _b_^2^ - 4__ac__ part of the formula is called the
_discriminant_. If the discriminant is positive, there will be two real
answers to the equation. If the discriminant is negative, there will be
two complex answers to the equation. Finally, if the discriminant is
zero, there will be a single real answer to the problem. If you want to
write a program to solve quadratic equations for you, it should take
these three possibilities into account.

.Solves a quadratic equation.
[source, java]
[[QuadraticProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Quadratic.java[]
----
<.> This program prompts the user and reads in values for `a`,
`b`, and `c`.
<.> Then, it computes the discriminant. 
<.> In the first case, we test to see if the discriminant is zero and print the single answer.
<.> Next, if the discriminant is negative, we compute the real and complex parts separately and output the
two answers.
<.> Finally, if the discriminant is positive, we find the two real
answers and output them.

Note that braces were not needed for the `if`,
`else`-`if`, and `else` blocks because each is composed of only a single
line of code. Although these `System.out.println()` method calls may
take up more than one line visually, Java interprets them as single
lines because they each only have a single semicolon (`;`).

The line `if(discriminant == 0.0)` is dangerous since we're using
`double` values. Because of rounding errors, the discriminant might not
be exactly zero even if it should be, mathematically. Industrial
strength code would probably check to see if the absolute value of the
discriminant is less than a very small number (such as 0.00000001).
Values that small would then be treated as if they were zero.

.20 Questions
====

In the time-honored game of 20 Questions, one person mentally chooses
something, and the other participants must guess what the thing is by
asking questions whose answer is either "`yes`" or "`no.`" In one
popular version, the person who chooses the thing starts by declaring
whether it is animal, vegetable, or mineral.

Using counting principles from math, 20 yes-or-no questions makes it
possible to differentiate 2^20^ = 1,048,576 items. If you're also told 
whether the thing is animal, vegetable, or
mineral, it should be possible to guess over 3 million items! At this point
in our development as Java programmers, we're not
yet ready to deal with such a large range of possibilities. To keep the
size of the code reasonable, let's narrow the field to 10 different
items: a lizard, an eagle, a dolphin, a human, some lead, a diamond, a
tomato, a peach, a maple tree, and a potato.

[[figure-flowchart]]
.Decision tree to distinguish 10 items.
image::flowchart.svg[scaledwidth=100%,pdfwidth=100%,width=100%]


Using these items, we can construct a tree of decisions,
starting with the decision between animal, vegetable, and mineral. If
the thing is an animal, we could then ask if it is a mammal. If it *is* a
mammal, we could ask if it lives on land, deciding between human and
dolphin. If it's *not* a mammal, we could ask if it flies, deciding
between an eagle and a lizard. We can construct similar questions for
the things in the vegetable and mineral categories, matching
<<figure-flowchart>>.

.Navigates the possible choices in the decision tree.
[source, java]
[[TwentyQuestionsProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/TwentyQuestions.java[]
----

The code in this example is straightforward, although even 10 items
makes for a lot of `if` and `else` blocks. Other than the `if`-`else`
statements, only simple input and output are needed to make the program
function. For proper `String` comparison, it's necessary to use the
`equals()` method to test if two `String` values are the same.

Note that we've added comments specifying what we assume is the case
for each `else` block. If we were being more careful, we should test for
the `"y"` and `"n"` cases and then give an error message when the user
inputs something unexpected, like `"x"` or `"149"` or even `"no"`.
Again, note that no braces are needed for the final `if`-`else` blocks
in which the guess is made, since each of these guesses requires only a
single line of code.

You might be curious how to make a real 20 Questions game that could
learn over time. To do so, many more programming tools are necessary:
repetition, data structures (so that you can organize the questions),
and file input and output (so that you can store new information
permanently). These concepts are covered in later chapters.

====


==== `switch` statements

The `if` statement is the workhorse of Java conditional execution. With
enough care, you can craft code that can make any fixed sequence of
decisions with arbitrary complexity. Even so, the `if` statement can be
a little clumsy because it only allows you to choose between two
alternatives. After all, a conditional can only be `true` or `false`.
Certainly, decisions can be nested, allowing for more than two
possibilities, but long lists of possibilities can be cumbersome and hard to read.

For example, imagine that we want to create a program that determines
the appropriate gift for a wedding anniversary. Below is a table of
traditional categories of gifts based on the anniversary year.

[.center%autowidth,cols="^.^,<.^,^,^.^,<.^",options="header",]
|=================================
|Year |Gift | |Year |Gift
|1 |Paper | |13 |Lace
|2 |Cotton | |14 |Ivory
|3 |Leather | |15 |Crystal
|4 |Fruit | |20 |China
|5 |Wood | |25 |Silver
|6 |Candy / Iron | |30 |Pearl
|7 |Wool / Copper | |35 |Coral
|8 |Bronze / Pottery | |40 |Ruby
|9 |Pottery / Willow | |45 |Sapphire
|10 |Tin / Aluminum | |50 |Gold
|11 |Steel | |55 |Emerald
|12 |Silk / Linen | |60 |Diamond
|=================================

Let `year` be a variable of type `int` containing the year in question.
A structure of `if`-`else` statements that can determine the appropriate
gift based on the year is below.

[source,java]
----
String gift;
if(year == 1)
    gift = "Paper";
else if(year == 2)
    gift = "Cotton";
else if(year == 3)
    gift = "Leather";
else if(year == 4)
    gift = "Fruit";
else if(year == 5)
    gift = "Wood";
else if(year == 6)
    gift = "Candy / Iron";
else if(year == 7)
    gift = "Wool / Copper";
else if(year == 8)
    gift = "Bronze / Pottery";
else if(year == 9)
    gift = "Pottery / Willow";
else if(year == 10)
    gift = "Tin / Aluminum";
else if(year == 11)
    gift = "Steel";
else if(year == 12)
    gift = "Silk / Linen";
else if(year == 13)
    gift = "Lace";
else if(year == 14)
    gift = "Ivory";
else if(year == 15)
    gift = "Crystal";
else if(year == 20)
    gift = "China";
else if(year == 25)
    gift = "Silver";
else if(year == 30)
    gift = "Pearl";
else if(year == 35)
    gift = "Coral";
else if(year == 40)
    gift = "Ruby";
else if(year == 45)
    gift = "Sapphire";
else if(year == 50)
    gift = "Gold";
else if(year == 55)
    gift = "Emerald";
else if(year == 60)
    gift = "Diamond";
else
    gift = "No traditional gift";
----

This code stores the correct value in `gift`. Note that we are using the
feature of `if` statements that treats an entire `if` statement as one
statement. If we used braces to group things properly, the code would
become unreadable and unmanageably large.

[source,java]
----
String gift;
if(year == 1) {
    gift = "Paper";
}
else {
    if(year == 2) {
        gift = "Cotton";
    }
    else {
        if(year == 3) {
            gift = "Leather";
        }
        else {
            if(year == 4) {
                gift = "Fruit";
            }
            .
            .
            .
----

It appears that there's some kind of `else if` construct in Java, but
there isn't. Still, careful use of the rules for braces allows us to
write code that nicely expresses a sequence of alternatives.

Another way of expressing a long sequence of alternatives is by using a
`switch` statement. A `switch` statement takes a single integer type
value (`int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`, `char`) or a `String` and jumps
to a case corresponding to the input. We can recode the anniversary gift
example using a `switch` statement as follows.

[source,java]
----
String gift;
switch(year) {
    case 1:  gift = "Paper"; break;
    case 2:  gift = "Cotton"; break;
    case 3:  gift = "Leather"; break;
    case 4:  gift = "Fruit"; break;
    case 5:  gift = "Wood"; break;
    case 6:  gift = "Candy / Iron"; break;
    case 7:  gift = "Wool / Copper"; break;
    case 8:  gift = "Bronze / Pottery"; break;
    case 9:  gift = "Pottery / Willow"; break;
    case 10: gift = "Tin / Aluminum"; break;
    case 11: gift = "Steel"; break;
    case 12: gift = "Silk / Linen"; break;
    case 13: gift = "Lace"; break;
    case 14: gift = "Ivory"; break;
    case 15: gift = "Crystal"; break;
    case 20: gift = "China"; break;
    case 25: gift = "Silver"; break;
    case 30: gift = "Pearl"; break;
    case 35: gift = "Coral"; break;
    case 40: gift = "Ruby"; break;
    case 45: gift = "Sapphire"; break;
    case 50: gift = "Gold"; break;
    case 55: gift = "Emerald"; break;
    case 60: gift = "Diamond"; break;
    default: gift = "No traditional gift"; break;
}
----

Just like an `if` statement, a `switch` statement always has parentheses
enclosing some argument. Unlike an `if`, the argument of a `switch` must
be some kind of data that can be expressed as an integer or a `String`,
not a `boolean`. For each of the possible values you want the `switch`
to handle, you write a `case` statement. A `case` statement consists of
the keyword `case` followed by a constant value, either a literal or a
named constant, then a colon. When executed, the JVM jumps to the
matching `case` label and starts executing code there. If there is no
matching `case` label, the JVM goes to the `default` label. If there is
no `default` label, the entire `switch` statement is skipped.

One unusual feature of `switch` statements is that execution _falls
through_ `case` statements. This means that you can use many different
`case` statements for a single segment of executable code. The execution
of code in a `switch` statement jumps out when it hits a `break`
statement. However, `break` statements are not required, as shown in
this `switch` statement that gives location information for all of the
telephone area codes in New York state.

[source,java]
----
String location = "";
switch(code) {
    case 917: location = "Cellular: ";
    case 212:
    case 347:
    case 646:
    case 718: location += "New York City"; break;

    case 315: location = "Syracuse"; break;

    case 516: location = "Nassau County"; break;

    case 518: location = "Albany"; break;

    case 585: location = "Rochester"; break;

    case 607: location = "South Central New York"; break;

    case 631: location = "Suffolk County"; break;

    case 716: location = "Buffalo"; break;

    case 845: location = "Lower Hudson Valley"; break;

    case 914: location = "Westchester County"; break;

    default:  location = "Unknown Area Code"; break;
}
----

As you can see, five different area codes are used by New York City. By
leaving out the `break` statements, values of `212`, `347`, `646`, and
`718` all have `"New York City"` stored into `location`. Area code 917
was originally designated for cellular phones and pagers although now it
includes some landlines. By cleverly putting the statement for `917` ahead of
the other New York City entries, a value of `917` first stores
`"Cellular: "` into `location` and then falls through and appends
`"New York City"`. For each of these five area codes, execution in the
`switch` statement ends only when the `break` statement is reached.

The remaining nine area codes are separate. Each of them does a
single assignment and then breaks out of the `switch` block. Finally,
the `default` label is used if the area code doesn't match one of the
given codes. Note that we've ordered the (non-NYC) area codes in
ascending order for the sake of readability. As shown in the
`917` example, there's no rule about the ordering of the labels. Even
the `default` label can occur anywhere in the `switch` block you want,
although it's common to put it at the end. Also, the `break` after the
`default` label is unnecessary because execution exits the `switch`
block anyway. Nevertheless, it's always wise to end on a `break`, in
the event that you add more cases in later.

Carelessness is always something to watch out for in `switch`
statements. Leaving out a `break` statement can cause disastrous and
difficult to discover bugs. The compiler does not warn you about missing
`break` statements, either. It's entirely your responsibility to use them
appropriately. Because of the dangers involved, it's often safe to
use `if`-`else` statements. Any `switch` statement can be rewritten as
some combination of `if`-`else` statements, but the reverse is not true.
The benefit of `switch` statements is their ability to list many
alternatives clearly. Their drawbacks include the ease of making a
mistake, an inability to express ranges of data or most types (`double`,
`float`, or any reference type other than `String`), and limited
expressive power. They should be used only when their benefit of clearly
displaying a list of data outweighs the drawbacks.

Next we give a number of examples to help you get more familiar with
`switch` statements.

.Days in the month
====

There are fewer uses for `switch` statements than `if` statements.
Nevertheless, there are problems where their
fall-through behavior can be useful. Imagine that you need to write a
program that gives the length of each month (with the assumption that February always
has 28 days). Given the month as a number, we can use `switch` statements to write a program
that maps the number of the month to the number of days it contains.

.Computes the number of days in a given month.
[source, java]
[[DaysInMonthProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/DaysInMonth.java[]
----

<.> This program has a single label for February setting `days` to 28.
<.> Then,
there are labels for April, June, September, and November, months that
each have 30 days.
<.> Finally, the large block of January, March, May,
July, August, October, and December all set `days` to 31.

It would be
easy to extend this code to prompt the user for a year so that you could
integrate the leap year code from above for the February case. Note also
that we didn't use a `default` label. You might want to set `days` to
some special value (like `-1`) for invalid months.

In this program it's necessary to initialize `days` to some value, in this case `0`.
Otherwise, the program won't compile, since it'll try to print out the
value inside `days`, a value that won't exist if `month` is not in the range 1 through 12.

[[ordinalNumbersExample]]
.Ordinal numbers
====

The term _ordinal numbers_ refers to numbers that are used for ordering
within a set of items: first, second, third, and so on. When writing
these numbers with numerals in English, it is common to append two
letters to the end of the numeral to give the reader a clue that these
numerals should be read with their ordinal names: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so
on.

Unlike most things in English, the rules for deciding which two letters
are relatively simple. If the number ends in a 1, the letters "`st`"
should generally be used. If the number ends in a 2, the letters "`nd`"
should generally be used. If the number ends in a 3, the letters "`rd`"
should generally be used. For most other numbers, the letters "`th`"
should be used. We can use a `switch` statement to write a program to
give the correct ordinal endings for most numbers as follows.

.Appends the appropriate suffix to a numeral to make it an ordinal.
[source, java]
[[OrdinalsProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Ordinals.java[]
----

This program prompts and then reads in an `int` from the user. We then
find the remainder of `number` when it's divided by 10, yielding its
last digit. Based on this digit, we can pick from the four possibilities
and output the correct ordinal number in most cases. Unfortunately, the
names for English numbers have an inconsistent naming convention between 11 and 19, inclusive,
and the ordinals for any number ending in 11, 12, or 13 will be given the wrong
suffix by our code. We leave a more complete solution as an exercise.

.Astrology
====

Many cultures practice astrology, a tradition that the time of a
person's birth impacts his or her personality or future. One important
element of Chinese astrology is their zodiac, consisting of 12 animals.
Each consecutive year in a 12-year cycle corresponds to an animal.
Because this system repeats, the year one is born in modulo 12
identifies the animal. Below is a table giving these values. For
example, if you were born in 1979, 1979 mod 12 ≡ 11; thus, you would be a Ram.
Note that this arrangement is based on years in the Gregorian calendar.
Chinese astrologers do not list the Monkey as the first animal in the cycle.
Note that the names of these animals are also sometimes translated in slightly
different ways.


[.center%autowidth,cols="<.>,^.>,^,<.>,^.>",options="header",]
|=====================
|Animal | Year +
modulo 12| 
|Animal | Year +
modulo 12
|Monkey |0 | |Tiger |6
|Rooster |1 | |Rabbit |7
|Dog |2 | |Dragon |8
|Boar |3 | |Snake |9
|Rat |4 | |Horse |10
|Ox |5 | |Ram |11
|=====================

Unfortunately, this table is not very accurate because it's based on
numbering from the Gregorian calendar. The years in question actually
start and end based on Chinese New Year, which occurs between January 21
and February 20. As a consequence, you may miscalculate your animal if
your birthday is early in the year. Since calculating the date of
Chinese New Year is challenging, let's ignore this problem for the
moment and write a program using a `switch` statement designed to
correctly output the animal corresponding to an input birth year.

In Western astrology, an important element associated with a person's
birth is also called a zodiac sign. The dates for determining this kind
of zodiac sign are given by the preceding table.

If you want to implement the rules for this zodiac in code, a `switch`
statement is a good place to start, but you also have to put `if`
statements for each month to test the exact range of dates.

This program is just slightly more complex than the program for the
Chinese zodiac. You still need to jump to 12 different cases (numbered
1-12 instead of 0-11), but additional day information is needed to pin
down the sign.

=== Solution: Monty Hall

We now return to the Monty Hall simulation described at the beginning of
the chapter. Recall that objects of the `Random` class allow us to generate all
kinds of random values. To implement this simulation successfully, our
program must make the decisions needed to set up the game for the
user as well as respond to the user's input. 

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/MontyHall.java[lines=1..11]
----
<.> We begin with the `import`
statement needed to use both the `Scanner` and `Random` class
and then define the `MontyHall` class.
<.> In the `main()` method we first decide which of the three doors is the
winner. To do so, we instantiate a `Random` object and use it to
generate a random number that is either 0, 1, or 2 by calling the
`nextInt()` method with an argument of `3`. We could have added 1 to
this value to get a random choice of 1, 2, or 3, but many counting
systems in computer science start with 0 instead of 1. We might as well
embrace it.
<.> Next, we prompt the user to pick from the three doors
and read the choice.
<.> Finally, we declare two more `int` values to keep
track of which door to open and which door is the alternative that the
user can choose to change over to.

Now, we have to navigate a complicated series of decisions. 

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/MontyHall.java[lines=13..38]
----
<.> In this
segment of code, we tackle the possibility that the user happened
to choose the winning door. To obey the rules of the game, we must
randomly pick which of the two other doors to open.
<.> First, we determine
which are the other two doors and save them in `low` and `high`,
respectively.
<.> Then, we generate a random number.
<.> If the random number
is less than 0.5, we keep the lower numbered door as an alternative
choice for the user and open the higher numbered door.
<.> If the random number is greater than or equal to 0.5, we do the opposite.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/MontyHall.java[lines=39..59]
----
<.> This `else` block covers the case that the player did *not* pick the
winning door the first time. Unlike the previous code segment, we no
longer have a choice of which door to open.
<.> Instead, we must always
make the winner the alternative for the user to pick. Then, we simply
determine which door is left over so that we can open it.

Note that the
braces surrounding the blocks for each of the braces surrounding the
blocks for each of the three possible values of `choice` are not
necessary but are included for readability.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/MontyHall.java[lines=60..74]
----
<.> This final segment of code informs the user which door has been opened.
<.> It prompts the user to change his or her decision.
<.> Depending on the
final choice, the program says whether or not the user wins gold or
junk.

=== Concurrency: Selection

Selection statements (`if` and `switch`) seem to have
little to do with concurrency or parallelism. Selection allows you to
choose between alternatives while concurrency is about the interaction
between different threads of execution. As it turns out, there are two
reasons why selection and concurrency are deeply related to each other.

The first reason is that selection is one of the most basic tools in
Java. It's impossible to go more than a few lines of a code without
encountering a selection statement, usually an `if`.
Concurrent programs are not exempt from this dependence on `if`
statements. Making decisions is at the heart of all programming
languages running on all computers.

The second, more troubling reason is related to a problem with
some concurrent programs called a _race condition_, which is discussed
in detail in <<ch14-synchronization#ch14-synchronization>>. Remember, one of
the biggest challenges of programming a computer is thinking in a
completely sequential and logical way. Each line of code is executed one
after the other. Adding in `if` statements means that some code is
executed only if a condition is true and skipped otherwise. Consider the
following fragment of code:

[source,java]
----
if(!matches.areLit() && !flyingSparks) {
    storageRoom.enter();
    dynamite.unpack();
}
----

In this `if` statement, an imaginary agent only enters the storage room
and unpacks the dynamite if the matches are not lit and there are no
flying sparks. When execution reaches the first line inside the `if`
block, we are certain that `matches.areLit()` returned `false` and
`flyingSparks` is `false`. This is a one-time check. If the first thing
that happens inside the `if` block is code that lights the matches, Java
will *not* jump out of the `if` statement.

As always, the programmer is responsible for making an `if` statement
that makes sense. It's possible that entering the storage room or
unpacking the dynamite causes sparks to fly or matches to burst into
flames spontaneously, but it seems unlikely. If the `storageRoom` and
`dynamite` objects were written by other people, we would expect their
documentation to explain unusual side-effects of this kind. In a
sequential program, the programmer can be reasonably sure that it's
safe to unpack the dynamite.

Consider another fragment of code:

[source,java]
----
matches.light();
flyingSparks = sparklers.light(matches);
----

This code appears to light the matches and then to use the lit matches to set
some sparklers on fire. Presumably, if the process was successful,
`flyingSparks` will have the value `true`. This code is reasonable and
potentially helpful. If you were celebrating the 4^th^ of July or needed
to signal a passing helicopter to rescue you from a desert island,
lighting sparklers could be a great idea. This sparkler-lighting code
could occur before the dynamite-unpacking code or after it, but, in a sequential
program, the protection of the `if` statement keeps our hero from being blown up if
she tries to unpack the dynamite with lit sparklers.

In a concurrent program, all bets are off. Another thread of execution
can be operating at the very same time. It's as if our hero is trying to
unpack the dynamite while the villain is lighting sparklers and tossing
them into the storage room. If the thread of execution gets to the `if`
statement and makes sure that the matches aren't lit and that there are
no flying sparks, it continues onward. If sparks start flying after that
check, it still continues onward, oblivious of the fact. Even though
this risk of explosion exists, it depends on the timing of the two (or
more) concurrent threads of execution. It might be possible to run a
program 1,000 times with no problem. But if the timing is wrong on the
1,001^st^ time, *BOOM!*

At this point, you don't need to worry about values inside your `if`
statements being changed by other segments of code, but that problem is
at the heart of why concurrent programming can be so difficult. Whether
or not you're programming concurrently, it's important to keep
in mind the assumptions your code makes and the way different parts of
your program interact with each other.

=== Exercises
*Conceptual Problems*

. Given that _x_, _y_, and _z_ are
propositions in Boolean logic, make a truth table for the expression
¬(_x_ ∧ ¬__y__) ⊕ ¬__z__.
//There's some AsciiDoctor weirdness on the next line if the spaces inside the outer parentheses are removed.
. What's the value of the Boolean expression ¬( (T ⊕ F) ∧ ¬(F ∨ T) )?
. The calculation to determine the leap year given in
<<leapYearExample>> uses three `if` statements and three
`else` statements. Write the leap year calculation using a single `if`
and a single `else`. Feel free to use `boolean` connectors such as `||`
and `&&`.
.  The XOR operator (`^`) is useful for combining `boolean` values, but
it can be replaced with a more commonly used *relational* operator in
Java. Which one?
. De Morgan's laws are the following, which show that the process of
negating a clause changes an AND to an OR and vice versa.
+
¬(_x_ ∧ _y_) = ¬__x__ ∨ ¬__y__ +
¬(_x_ ∨ _y_) = ¬__x__ ∧ ¬__y__
+
Create truth tables to verify both of these statements.
. Use De Morgan's laws given above to rewrite the following statement
in Java to an equivalent statement that contains no negations.
+
[source,java]
----
boolean value = !((x != 4) && (y < 2));
----
. Consider the following fragment of code.
+
[source,java]
----
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
if(y > 10 && (x = 10) > 5)
    y++;
System.out.println("x: " + x);
System.out.println("y: " + y);
----
+
What's the output? Is the output changed if the condition of the `if`
statement is changed to `y > 10 & (x = 10) > 5`? Why?
. Consider the following fragment of code.
+
[source,java]
----
int a = 7;
if(a++ == 7)
    System.out.println("Seven");
else
    System.out.println("Not seven");
----
+
What's the output? Is the output changed if the condition of the `if`
statement is changed to `++a == 7`? Why? +
Note: It is generally wise to
avoid increment, decrement, and assignment statements in the condition
of an `if` statement because of the confusion that can arise.


*Programming Practice*

. Write programs that:
..  Read in two `double` values and print the
larger of the two of them.
..  Read in *three* `double` values and print the largest of the three out.
Note: You should use nested `if` statements.
. [[coinNamesExercise]] Write programs that:
..  Read an `int` value from the user specifying a certain number of
cents. Use `if` statements to print out the name of the corresponding
coin in U.S. currency according to the table below. If the value doesn't
match any coin, print `no coin`.
+
[.center%autowidth,cols="^,^",options="header",]
|===============
|Cents |Coin
|1 |penny
|5 |nickel
|10 |dime
|25 |quarter
|50 |half-dollar
|100 |dollar
|===============
..  Read a `String` value from the user that gives one of the 6 coin
names given in the table above. Use `if` statements to print out the
corresponding number of cents for the input. If the name doesn't many
any coin, print `unknown coin`.
. Re-implement both parts from <<coinNamesExercise>> using `switch` statements instead of `if` statements.
. [[ordinalNumbersExercise]] Expand the program given in
<<ordinalNumbersExample>> to give the correct suffixes (always
"`th`") for numbers that end in 11, 12, and 13. Use the modulus operator
to find the last two digits of the number. Using an `if`
statement, a `switch` statement, or a combination, check for those three
cases before going into the normal cases.
. At the bottom of <<_switch_statements,Section 4.3.3>>, we use a
`switch` statement to determine the location of various area codes in
New York state. Write an equivalent fragment of code using `if`-`else`
statements instead.
. Every member of your secret club has an ID number. These ID numbers
are between 1 and 1,000,000 and have two special characteristics: They
are multiples of 7 and all end with a 3 in the one's place. For example,
63 is the smallest such value, and 999,943 is the largest such value.
Write a program that prompts the user for an `int` value, reads it in,
and then says whether or not it could be used as an ID number. Note: You
need to use the modulus operator in two different ways to test the value
correctly.
. According to the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) used by the
United States, Canada, and a number of smaller countries, a legal
telephone number takes the form `XYY-XYY-YYYY`, where `X` is any digit
2-9 and `Y` is any digit 0-9. Write a program that reads in a `String`
from the user and verifies that it is a legal NANP phone number. The
length of the entire `String` must be 12. The fourth and eight
characters in the `String` (with indexes `3` and `7`) must be hyphens
(`-`), and all the remaining digits must be in the correct range. Use
the `charAt()` method of the `String` class to get the `char` value at
each index. Note: There are several ways to structure the `if`
statements you need to use, but the number of conditions may become
large. (23 or more!)
. Re-implement the solution to the Monty Hall program given in
<<Solution: Monty Hall>> using `JOptionPane` to generate GUIs for
input and output.
