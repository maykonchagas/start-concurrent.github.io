=== Introduction

With one exception, all of the types we've talked about in this book
have held a single value. For example, an `int` variable can only
contain a single `int` value. If you try to put a second `int` value
into a variable, it will overwrite the first.

The `String` type, of course, is the exception. `String` objects can
contain `char` sequences of any length from 0 up to a practically
limitless size (the theoretical maximum length of a Java `String` is
`Integer.MAX_INT`, more than 650 times the length of _War and Peace_).
As remarkable as `String` objects are, this chapter is about a more
general kind of list called an _array_. We can create arrays to hold a
list of any type of variable in Java.

The ability to work with lists expands the scope of problems that we can
solve. Beyond simple lists, we can use the same tools to create tables,
grids, and other structures to solve fascinating problems like the one
that comes next.

=== Problem: Game of Life

Some physicists insist that the rules governing the universe are
horribly complicated. Some insist that the fundamental laws are simple
and only their overall interaction is complex. With the power to do
simulations quickly, computer scientists have shown that some systems
can exhibit very complex interactions using simple rules. Perhaps the
best known examples of these systems are _cellular automata_, of which
Conway's Game of Life is the most famous.

The framework for Conway's Game of Life is an infinite grid made up of
squares called cells. Some cells in the grid are black (or alive, to
give it a biological flavor), and the rest are white (or dead). Any
given cell has 8 neighbors as shown in the figure below.

[.text-center]
.Cell (shown in gray) surrounded by 8 neighboring cells.
image::cell.svg[scaledwidth=25%,pdfwidth=25%,width=25%,align="center"]

The pattern of alive and dead cells at any given time on the grid is
called a _generation_. To determine the next generation, we use the
following rules.

1.  If a living cell has fewer than two living neighbors, it dies from
loneliness.
2.  If a living cell has more than three neighbors, it dies because of
overcrowding.
3.  If a living cell has exactly two or three living neighbors, it lives
to the next generation.
4.  If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes a living
cell.

These four simple rules allow for more complex interactions than you might expect.
The patterns that emerge from applying these rules to a starting
configuration of alive and dead cells strike a balance between complete
chaos and rigid order. As the name of the game implies, the similarity
to biological patterns of development can be surprising.

Your problem is to create a Life simulator of size _n_ × _m_,
specific values for which will be discussed below. The
program should simulate the process at a speed that is engaging to
watch, with a new generation every tenth of a second. The program should
begin by randomly making 10% of all the cells living and the rest dead.

==== Terminal limitations

One problem you might be worrying about is how to display the
simulation. In <<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>> you'll learn how to make a graphical user interface (GUI)
that can display a grid of cells in black and white and much more
interesting things as well. For now, the main tool that we can use for
output is still the terminal. The output method we recommend is printing
an asterisk (`'*\'`) for a living cell and a space (`' '`) for a dead
one. In this way you can easily see the patterns form on the screen and
change over time.

The classic terminal isn't very big. For this reason, we suggest that
you set the height of your simulation to 24 rows and the width of your
simulation to 80 columns. These dimensions conform to the most ancient
terminal sizes. If your terminal screen is much larger, you can change
the width and height later to perform a larger simulation. No matter how
large the display for the game is, the ideal size of the game.
Because our size is so limited, we must deal with the problem of a cell on the boundary.
Anything beyond the boundaries should be counted as dead. Thus, a cell right on the edge
of the simulation grid can have a maximum of 5 neighbors. A cell in one
of the four corners can only have 3 neighbors.

In order to give the appearance of smooth transitions, you need to print
out each new generation of cells quickly, and in the same locations as
the previous generation. Simply printing one set after another will not
achieve this effect unless your terminal screen is exactly 24 rows tall.
So, you will need to clear the screen each time. In an effort to be
platform independent, Java does not provide an easy way to clear the
terminal screen. A quick and simple hack is to simply print out 100
blank lines before printing the next generation. This hack will work as
long as your terminal is not significantly more than 100 rows in height.
If it is, you'll need to print a larger number of blank rows.

Finally, you need to wait a short period of time between generations so
that the user can see each configuration before it's cleared away and
replaced by the next one. The simplest way to do this is by having your
program go to sleep for a short period of time, a tenth of a second as
we suggested before. The code to make your program sleep for that amount
of time is:

[source,java]
----
try { Thread.sleep(100); }
catch(InterruptedException e) {}
----

We'll explain this code in much greater detail in <<ch13-concurrency#ch13-concurrency>>.
The key item of importance is the number passed into the `sleep()` method.
This value is the number of milliseconds you want your program to sleep.
100 milliseconds is, of course, one tenth of a second.

In order to simulate the Game of Life, we need to store information,
namely the liveness or deadness of cells, in a grid. First, we need to
discuss the simpler task of storing data in a list.

=== Concepts: Lists of data

Lists of data are of paramount importance in many different areas of
life: shopping lists, packing lists, lists of employees working at a
company, address books, top ten lists, and more. Lists are even more
important in programming. As you know, one of the great strengths of
computers is their speed. If we have a long list of data, we can use
that speed to perform operations on all the data quickly. E-mail
contact lists, entries in a database, and cells in a spreadsheet are
just a few of the most obvious ways that lists come up in computer
applications.

Even in Java, there are many different ways to record a list of
information, but a list is only one form of _data structure_. As the
name implies, a data structure is a way to organize data, whether in a
list, in a tree, in sorted order, in some kind of hierarchy, or in any
other way that might be useful. We'll only talk about the array data
structure in this chapter, but other data structures will be discussed
in <<ch18-dynamic-data-structures#ch18-dynamic-data-structures>>.
Below, we give a short explanation of some of the attributes any given
data structure might have.

==== Data structure attribute

Contents:::
  Keeping only a single value in a data structure defeats the purpose of
  a data structure. But, if we can store more than a single value, must
  all of those values come from the same type? If a data structure can
  hold several different types of data, we call it _heterogeneous_, but
  if it can only hold one type, we call it _homogeneous_.
Size:::
  The size of a data structure may be something that's fixed when it's
  created or it could change on the fly. If a data structure's size or
  length can change, we call it a _dynamic_ data structure. If the data
  structure has a size or length that can never change after it's been
  created, we call it a _static_ data structure.
Element Access:::
  One of the reasons there are so many different data structures is that
  different ways of structuring data are better or worse for a given
  task. For example, if your task is to add a list of numbers, then
  you're expecting to access every single element in the list. However, if
  you're searching for a word in a dictionary, you don't want to check
  every dictionary entry to find it. +
{empty} +
  Some data structures are optimized so that you can efficiently read,
  insert, or delete only a single item, often the first (or last) item
  in the data structure. Some data structures only allow you to move
  through the structure sequentially, one item after another. Such a
  data structure has what is called _sequential access_. Still others
  allow you to jump randomly to any point you want inside the data
  structure efficiently. These data structures have what is called
  _random access_. Advanced programmers take into account many different
  factors before deciding which data structure is best suited to their
  problem.

==== Characteristics of an array

Now that we've defined these attributes, we can say that an array is a
homogeneous, static data structure with random access. An array is
homogeneous because it can only hold a list of a single type of data,
such as `int`, `double`, or `String`. An array is static because it has
a fixed length that is set only when the array is instantiated. An array
also has random access because jumping to any element in the array is
fast and takes about the same amount of time as jumping to any
other.

An array is a list of a specific type of elements that has length
_n_, a length specified when the array is created. Each of
the _n_ elements is indexed using a number between 0 and
_n_ - 1]. Once again, zero-based counting rears its ugly
head. Consider the following list of items: {9, 4, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3}

If this list is stored in an array, the first element, 9,
would have index 0, 4 would have index
1, and so on, finishing at 3 with an index
of 6, although the total number of items is
7. Not all languages use zero-based counting for array
indexes, but many do, including C, {cpp}, and Java. The reason that
languages like C originally used zero-based counting for indexes is that
the variable corresponding to the array is an address inside the
computer's memory giving the first element in the array. Thus, an index
of 0 is 0 times the size of an element added to the starting address,
and an index of 5 is 5 times the size of an element added to the
starting address. So, zero-based indexes gave a quick way for the
program to compute where in memory a given element of an array is.

=== Syntax: Arrays in Java

The idea of a list is not mysterious. Numbering each element of the list
is natural, even though the numbers start at 0 instead of 1.
Nevertheless, arrays are the source of many errors that cause Java programs
to crash. Below, we explain the basics of creating arrays, indexing into
arrays, and using arrays with loops. Then, there's an extra subsection
explaining how to send data from a file to a program as if the file were
being typed in by a user. Using this technique can save a lot of
time when you're experimenting with arrays.

==== Array declaration and instantiation

To create an array, you usually need to create an array variable first.
Remember that an array is a homogeneous data structure, meaning that it
can only store elements of a single type. When you create an array
variable, you have to specify what that type is. To declare an array
variable, you use the type it's going to hold, followed by square
brackets (`[]`), followed by the name of the variable. For example, if
you want to create an array called `numbers` that can hold integers, you
would type the following.

[source,java]
----
int[] numbers;
----

If you have some C or {cpp} programming experience, you might be used to
the brackets being on the other side of the variable, like so.

[source,java]
----
int numbers[];
----

In Java, both declarations are perfectly legal and equivalent. However,
the first declaration is preferred from a stylistic perspective. It
follows the pattern of using the type (an array of `int` values in this
case) followed by the variable name as the syntax for a declaration.

As we said, arrays are also static data structures, meaning that their
length is fixed at the time of their creation. Yet we didn't specify a
length above. This declaration has not yet created an array, just a
variable that can point at an array. In the second half of this chapter,
we will further discuss this difference between the way an array is
created and the way an `int` or any other variable of primitive type is
created. To actually create the array, we need to use another step,
involving the keyword `new`. Here's how we instantiate an array of
`int` type with 10 elements.

[source,java]
----
numbers = new int[10];
----

We use the keyword `new`, followed by the type of element, followed by
the number of elements the array can hold in square brackets. This new
array is stored into `numbers`. In other words, the variable `numbers`
is now a name for the array. Commonly, the two steps of declaring and
instantiating an array will be combined into one line of code.

[source,java]
----
int[] numbers = new int[10];
----

It's always possible to separate the two steps. In some cases, a single
variable might be used to point at an array of one particular length,
then changed to point at an array of another length, and so on, as
below.

[source,java]
----
int[] numbers;
numbers = new int[10];
numbers = new int[100];
numbers = new int[1000];
----

Here, the variable `numbers` starts off pointing at no array. Next, it's
made to point at a new array with 10 elements. Then, it's made to
point at a new array with 100 elements, ignoring the 10 element array.
Finally, it's made to point at an array with 1,000 elements, ignoring
the 100 element array. Remember, the arrays themselves are static; their
lengths can't change. The array type variables, however, can point at
different arrays with different lengths, provided that they're still
the right type (in this case, arrays of `int` values).

What values are inside the array when it's first created? Let's return
to the case where `numbers` points at a new array with 10 elements. Each
of those elements contains the `int` value `0`, as shown below.

[.text-center]
.Array elements showing index values.
image::array.svg[scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=75%,width=75%,align="center"]


Whenever an array is instantiated, each of its _n_ elements
is set to some default value. For `int`, `long`, `short`, and `byte`
this value is `0`. For `double` and `float`, this value is `0.0`. For
`char`, this value is `'\0'`, a special unprintable character. For
`boolean`, this value is `false`. For `String` or any other reference
type, this value is `null`, a special value that means there's no
object.

It's also possible to use a list to initialize an array. For example,
we can create an array of type `double` that contains the values `0.5`,
`1.0`, `1.5`, `2.0`, and `2.5` using the following code.

[source,java]
----
double[] increments = {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5};
----

This line of code is equivalent to using the `new` keyword to create a
`double` array with 5 elements and then setting each to the values
shown.

==== Indexing into arrays

To use a value in an array, you must _index_ into the array, using the
square brackets once again. Returning to the example of the `int` array
`numbers` with length 10, we can read the value at index 4 from the
array and print it out.

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(numbers[4]);
----

Until some other value has been stored there, the value of `numbers[4]` is `0`,
and so `0` is all that will be printed out.
We can set the value at `numbers[4]` to `17` as follows.

[source,java]
----
numbers[4] = 17;
----

Then, if we try to print out `numbers[4]`, `17` will be printed. The
contents of the `numbers` array will look like this.

[.text-center]
.Array showing contents of elements.
image::array2.svg[scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=75%,width=75%,align="center"]


The key thing to understand about indexing into an array is that it
gives you an element of the specified type. In other words, `numbers[4]`
*is* an `int` variable in every possible sense. You can read its value.
You can change its value. You can pass it into a method. It can be used
anywhere a normal `int` can be used, as in the following example.

[source,java]
----
int x = numbers[4];
double y = Math.sqrt(numbers[2]) + numbers[4];
numbers[9] = (int)(y*x);
----

Executing this code will store `17` into `x` and `17.0` into `y`. Then,
the product of those two, `289`, will be stored into `numbers[9]`.
Remember, in Java, the type on the left and the type on the right of the
assignment operator (`=`) must match, except in cases of automatic
casting, like storing an `int` value into a `double` variable. Since
they have the same type, it makes sense to store an element of an `int`
array like `numbers[4]` into an `int` variable like `x`. However, an
array of `int` values *can't* be stored into an `int` type.

[source,java]
----
int z = numbers;
----

This code will cause a compiler error. What would it mean? You can't put
a list of variables into a single variable. And the converse is true as
well.

[source,java]
----
numbers = 31;
----

This code will also cause a compiler error. A single value *can't* be
stored into a whole list. You would have to specify an index where it can be
stored. Furthermore, you must be careful to specify a legal index. No
negative index will ever be legal, and neither will an index greater
than or equal to the number of elements in the array.

[source,java]
----
numbers[10] = 99;
----

This code will compile correctly. If you remember, we instantiated the
array that `numbers` points at to have 10 elements, numbered 0 through
9. Thus, we are trying to store `99` into the element that is one index
*after* the last legal element. As a result, Java will cause an error
called an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to happen, which will crash
your program.

==== Using loops with arrays

One reason to use arrays is to avoid declaring 10 separate variables
just to have 10 `int` values to work with. But once you have the array,
you'll often need an automated way to process it. Any of the three
kinds of loops provides a powerful tool for performing operations on an
array, but the `for` loop is an especially good match. Here is an
example of a `for` loop that sets the values in an array to their
indexes.

[source,java]
----
int[] values = new int[100];
for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    values[i] = i;
----

This sample of code shows how easy it is to iterate over every element
in an array with a `for` loop, but it has a flaw in its style. Note that
the number `100` is used twice: once in the instantiation of the array
and a second time in the termination condition of the `for` loop. This
fragment of code works fine, but if the programmer changes the length of
`values` to be `50` or `500`, the bounds of the `for` loop will also
need to change. Furthermore, the length of the array might be determined
by user input.

To make the code both more robust and readable, we can use the `length`
field of the `values` array for the bound of the `for` loop.

[source,java]
----
int[] values = new int[100];
for(int i = 0; i < values.length; i++)
    values[i] = i;
----

The `length` field gives the length of the array that `values` points
to. If the programmer wants to instantiate the array with a different
length, that's fine. The `length` field will always reflect the correct
value. Whenever possible, use the `length` field of arrays in your code.
Note that the `length` field is read-only. If you try to set
`values.length` to a specific value, your code will not compile.

Setting the values in an array is only one possible task you can perform
with a loop. Let's assume that an array of type `double` named `data`
has been declared, instantiated, and filled with user input. We could
sum all its elements using the following code. A more elegant way to do
the same summation is discussed in <<Enhanced `for` loops>>.

[source,java]
----
double sum = 0.0;
for(int i = 0; i < data.length; i++)
    sum += data[i];
System.out.println("The sum of your data is: " + sum);
----

So far, we've only discussed operations on the *values* in an array. It
is important to realize that the *order* of those values can be equally
important. We're going to create an array of `char` type named
`letters`, initialized with some values, and then reverse the order of
the array.

[source,java]
----
char[] letters = {'b', 'y', 'z', 'a', 'n', 't', 'i', 'n', 'e'}; //<1>
int start = 0; //<2>
int end = letters.length - 1; //<3>
char temp;
while(start < end) { //<4>
    temp = letters[start]; //<5>
    letters[start] = letters[end];
    letters[end] = temp;
    start++; //<6>
    end--;
}
for(int i = 0; i < letters.length; i++) //<7>
    System.out.print(letters[i]);
----

<1> After initializing the `letters`
array, we declare `start` and `end`.
<2> `start` gets the value `0`, the
first index of `letters`.
<3> `end` gets the value `letters.length - 1`, the last valid index
of `letters`.
<4> The `while` loop continues as long as
the `start` is less than the `end`.
<5> The first three lines of each
iteration of the `while` loop will swap the `char` at index `start` with
the `char` at index `end`.
<6> The two lines after that will increment and
decrement `start` and `end`, respectively. When the two meet in the
middle, the entire array has been reversed.
<7> The simple `for` loop at the
end prints out each `char` in `letters`, giving the output `enitnazyb`.

Of course, we could have
printed out the array elements in reverse order without changing their
order, but we wanted to reverse them, perhaps because we will need them
reversed in the future.

==== Redirecting input

With arrays and loops, we can process a lot of data, but testing
programs that process a lot of data can be tedious. Instead of typing
data into the terminal, we can read data from a file. In Java, file I/O
is a messy process that involves several objects and method calls. We're
going to talk about it in depth in <<ch20-file-io#ch20-file-io>>, but for
now we can use a quick and easy workaround.

If you create a text file using a simple text editor, you can _redirect_
the file as input to a program. Everything you've written in the text
file is treated as if it were being typed into the command line by a
person. To do so, you type the command using `java` to run your class
file normally, type the `<` sign, and then type the name of the file you
want to use as input. For example, if you have a text file called
`numbers.txt` that you want to use as input to a program stored in
`Summer.class`, you could do so as follows.

----
java Summer < numbers.txt
----

Redirecting input this way is not a part of Java. Instead, it's a
feature of the terminal running under your OS. Not all operating systems
support input redirection, but virtually every flavor of Linux and Unix
do, as well as the Windows command line and the macOS terminal. We
could write the program mentioned above and give it the simple task of
summing all the numbers it gets as input.

.Sums a list of numbers given as input.
[source, java]
[[SummerProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Summer.java[]
----

Now, we can type out a file with a list of numbers in it and save it as
`numbers.txt`. To conform with the program we wrote, we should also put
the total count of numbers as the first value in the file. You can put
each number on a separate line or just leave a space between each one.
As long as they are separated by white space, the `Scanner` object will
take care of the rest. You'll have to type the numbers into the file
once, but then you can test your program over and over with the same file.

If you do run the program with the file you've created, you'll notice
that the program still prompts you once for the total count of numbers
and then prompts you many times to enter the next number. With
redirected input, all that text runs together in a bizarre way. All the
input is coming from `numbers.txt`. If you expect a program to read
strictly from redirected input, you can design your code a little
differently. For one thing, you don't need to have explicit prompts for
the user. For another, you can use a number of special methods from the
`Scanner` class. The `Scanner` class has a several methods like
`hasNextInt()` and `hasNextDouble()`. These methods will examine the
input and see if there is another legal `int` or `double` and return
`true` or `false` accordingly. If you expect a file to have only a long
sequence of `int` values, you can use `hasNextInt()` to determine if
you've reached the end of the file or not. Using `hasNextInt()`, we can
simplify the program and remove the expectation that the first number
gives the total count of numbers.

.Sums a list of numbers given as input without prompting the user.
[source, java]
[[QuietSummerProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/QuietSummer.java[]
----

On the other hand, you might be interested in the output of a program.
The output could be very long or it might take a lot of time to produce
or you might want to store it permanently. For these situations, it is
possible to _redirect output_ as well. Instead of printing to the
screen, you can send the output to a file of your choosing. The syntax
for this operation is just like the syntax for input redirection except
that you use the `>` sign instead of `<`. To run `QuietSummer` with
input from `numbers.txt` and output to `sum.txt`, we could do the
following.

`java QuietSummer < numbers.txt > sum.txt`

You would be free to examine `sum.txt` at any time with your text editor
of choice. When using output redirection, it makes more sense to run
`QuietSummer` than `Summer`. If we had run `Summer`, all of that
unnecessary output prompting the user to enter numbers would be saved in
`sum.txt`.

=== Examples: Array usage

Here are a few examples of practical array usage. We're going to
discuss some techniques useful mostly for searching and sorting.
Searching for values in a list seems mundane, but it's one of the most
practical tasks that a computer scientist routinely carries out. By
making a computer do the work, it saves human beings countless hours of
tedious searching and checking. Another important task is sorting.
Sorting a list can make future searches faster and is the simplest way
to find the median of a list of values. Sorting is a fundamental part of
countless real world problems.

In the examples below, we'll first discuss finding the largest (or
smallest) value in a list, move on to sorting lists, and then talk about
a task that searches for words, like a dictionary look up.

[[kingOfTheHillExample]]
.King of the hill
====

Finding the largest value input by a user is not difficult. Applying
that knowledge to an array is pretty straightforward as well. This
simple task is also a building block of the sorting algorithm we'll
discuss below. The key to finding the largest value in any list is to
keep a temporary variable that records the largest value found so far.
As we go along, we update the variable if we find a larger value. The
only trick is initializing the variable to some appropriate starting
value. We could initialize it to zero, but what if entire list of
numbers is negative? Then, our answer would be larger than any of the
numbers in the list. If our list of numbers is of type `int`, we could
initialize our variable to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, the smallest possible
`int`. This approach works, but you have to remember the name of the
constant, and it doesn't improve the readability of the code.

When working with an array, the best way to find the largest value in
the list is by setting your temporary variable to the first element
(index `0`) in the array. Below is a short snippet of code that finds
the largest value in an `int` array named `values` in exactly this way.

[source,java]
----
int largest = values[0];
for(int i = 1; i < values.length; i++)
    if(values[i] > largest)
        largest = values[i];
System.out.println("The largest value is " + largest);
----

Note that the `for` loop starts at `1` not `0`. Because `largest` is
initialized to be `values[0]`, there's no reason to check that value a second time.
Doing so would still give the correct answer, but it wastes a tiny
amount of time.

What's the feature of this code that makes it find the largest value?
The key is the `>` operator. With the change of a single character, we
could find the smallest value instead.

[source,java]
----
int smallest = values[0];
for(int i = 1; i < values.length; i++)
    if(values[i] < smallest)
        smallest = values[i];
System.out.println("The smallest value is " + smallest);
----

In addition to the necessary change from `>` to `<`, we also changed the
output and the name of the variable to avoid confusion. Now, we'll show
how repeatedly finding the smallest value in an array can be used to
sort it. Alternatively, the largest value could be used equally well.

[[selectionSortExample]]
.Selection sort
====

Sorting is the bread and butter of computer scientists. Much research
has been devoted to finding the fastest ways to sort a list of data. The
rest of the world assumes that sorting a list of data is trivial because
computer scientists have done such a good job solving this problem. The
name of the sorting algorithm we are going to describe below is
_selection sort_. It's *not* one of the fastest ways to sort data, but
it's simple and easy to understand.

The idea behind selection sort is to find the smallest element in an
array and put it at index `0` of the array. Then, from the remaining
elements, find the smallest element and put it at index `1` of the
array. The process continues, filling the array up from the beginning
with the smallest values until the entire array is sorted. If the length
of the array is _n_, we'll need to look for the smallest
element in the array _n_ - 1 times. By putting the code that
searches for the smallest value inside of an outer loop, we can write a
program that does selection sort of `int` values input by the user as
follows. This program's not very long, but there's a lot going on.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/SelectionSort.java[lines=1..11]
----
<.> After
instantiating a `Scanner`, we read in the total number of values the
list will hold. We cannot rely on the `hasNextInt()` method to tell us
when to stop reading values.
<.> We need to know up front how many values we
are going to store so that we can instantiate our array with the
appropriate length.
<.> Then, we read each value into the array using the
first `for` loop.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/SelectionSort.java[lines=12..20]
----
<.> The next `for` loop is where the actual sort happens. We start at index
`0` and then try to find the smallest value to be put in that spot.
Then, we move on to index `1`, and so on, just as we described before.
Note that we only go up to `n - 2`. We don't need to find the value to
put in index `n - 1`, because the rest of the list has the `n - 1`
smallest numbers in it and so the last number *must* already be the
largest.
<.> If you look carefully, you'll notice that the inner `for`
loop has the same overall shape as the loop used to find the smallest
value in the previous example; however, there is one key difference:
<.> Instead of storing the *value* of the smallest number in `smallest`, we
now store the *index* of the smallest number. We need to store the index
of the smallest number so that, in the next step, we can swap the
corresponding element with the element at `i`, the spot in the array
we're trying to fill.
<.> The three lines after the inner `for` loop are a
simple swap to do exactly that.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/SelectionSort.java[lines=21..25]
----
<.> After all the sorting is done, the final `for` loop prints out the newly
sorted list.

This program gives no prompts for user input, so it's well
designed for input redirection. If you're going to make a file
containing numbers you want to sort with this program, make sure that
the first number is the total count of numbers in the file.

Again, this program sorts the list in ascending order (from smallest to
largest). If you wanted to sort the list in descending order, you would
only need to change the `<` to a `>` in the comparison of the inner
`for` loop, although other changes are recommended for the sake of
readability.

[[wordSearchExample]]
.Word search
====

In this example, we read in a list of words and a long passage of
text and keep track of the number of times each word in the list occurs
in the passage. This kind of text searching has many applications.
Similar ideas are used in a spell checker that needs to look up words in
a dictionary. The incredibly valuable find and replace tools in modern
word processors use some of the same techniques.

To make this program work, however, we need to read in a (potentially
long) list of words and then a lot of text. We are forced to use input
redirection (or some other file input) because typing this text in
multiple times would be tedious. When we get to <<ch20-file-io#ch20-file-io>>,
we'll talk about ways to read from multiple files at the same
time. Right now, we can only redirect input from a single file, and so
we're forced to put the list of words at the top of the file, followed by
the text we want to search through.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/WordCount.java[lines=1..11]
----
<.> As in the last example, this program begins by reading in the length of
the list of words.
<.> Then, it instantiates the `String` array `words` to
hold these words.
<.> It also instantiates an array `counts` of type `int`
to keep track of the number of times each word is found. By default,
each element in `counts` is initialized to `0`.
<.> The first `for` loop in
the program reads in each word and stores it into the array `words`.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/WordCount.java[lines=12..20]
----
<.> The `while` loop reads in each word from the text following the list and
stores it in a variable called `temp`.
<.> Then, it loops through `words`
and tests to see if `temp` matches any of the elements in the list.
<.> If it does, it increases the value of the element of `counts` that has the
same index and breaks out of the inner `for` loop.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/WordCount.java[lines=21..24]
----
<.> After all the words in the text have been processed, the final `for`
loop prints out each word from the list, along with its counts.

This program uses two different arrays for bookkeeping: `words` contains
the words we are searching for and `counts` contains the number of times
each word has been found. These two arrays are separate data structures.
The only link between them is the code we wrote to maintain the
correspondence between their elements.

To give a clear picture of how this program should behave, here's a
sample input file with two paragraphs from the beginning of _The Count
of Monte Cristo_ by Alexandre Dumas.

....
7
and
at
bridge
for
pilot
vessel
walnut
On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signaled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Chateau d'If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city.
....

And here's the output one should get from running `WordCount` with
input redirected from the file given above.

....
The word counts are:
and 6
at 3
bridge 0
for 1
pilot 1
vessel 1
walnut 0
....

For this example, the program works fine. However, our program would
have given incorrect output if `ship`, `spectators`, or several other
words in the text had been on the word list. You see, the `next()`
method in the `Scanner` class reads in `String` values separated by
white space. The word `ship` appears twice in the text, but the second
instance is followed by a comma. Since the words are separated by white
space only, the `String` `"ship,"` does not match the `String` `"ship"`.
Dealing with punctuation is not difficult, but it would increase the
length of the code, so we leave it as an exercise.

[[statisticsExample]]
.Statistics
====

Imagine you're a teacher who has just given an exam. You want to
produce statistics for the class so that the students have some idea how
well they have done. You want to write a Java program to help you
produce the statistics, to save time now and in the future.

The statistics you want to collect are listed in the following table.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="<,<"]
|===========================================================
|Statistic |Description
|Maximum |Maximum score
|Minimum |Minimum score
|Mean |Average of all the scores
|Standard Deviation |Sample standard deviation of the scores
|Median |Middle value of the scores when ordered
|===========================================================

<<kingOfTheHillExample>> covered how to find the maximum and
minimum scores in a list. The mean is simply the sum of all the scores
divided by the total number of scores. Standard deviation is a little
bit trickier. It gives a measurement of how spread out the data is. Let
_n_ be the number of data points, label each data point
_x~i~_, where 1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_, and let
_μ_ be the mean of all the data points. Then, the
formula for the sample standard deviation is as follows.

//[stem]
//++++
//\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}
//++++

[.text-center]
image::deviation.svg[scaledwidth=25%,pdfwidth=25%,width=25%,align="center"]

Finally, if you sort a list of numbers in order, the median is the
middle value in the list, or the average of the two middle values, if
the list has an even length.

These kinds of statistical operations are useful and are packaged
into many important business applications such as Microsoft Excel. This
version will have a simple interface whose input comes from the command
line. First, the total number of scores will be entered. Then, each
score should be entered one by one. After all the data has been entered,
the program should compute and output the five values.

Below we give the solution to this statistics problem. Several different
tasks are combined here, but each of them should be reasonably easy to
solve after the previous examples.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Statistics.java[lines=1..9]
----
<.> In our solution, the `main()` method begins by reading in the total
number of scores.
<.> It declares an `int` array of that length named
`scores`.
<.> Then, we read in each of the scores and store them into
`scores`.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Statistics.java[lines=10..19]
----
<.> Here we declare variables `max`, `min`, and `sum` to hold, respectively,
the maximum, minimum, and sum of the elements in the array. Then, we set
all three variables to the value of the first element of the array.
These initializations make the following code work.
<.> In a single `for`
loop, we find the maximum, minimum, and sum of all the values in the
array.

We could have done so with three separate loops, but this
approach is more efficient. Setting `max` and `min` to `scores[0]`
follows the pattern we've used before, but setting `sum` to the same
value is also necessary in this case. Because the loop iterates from `1`
up to `scores.length - 1`, we must include the value at index `0` in
`sum`. Alternatively, we could have set `sum` to `0` and started the
`for` loop at `i = 0`.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Statistics.java[lines=20..23]
----

In this short snippet of code, we compute the mean, being careful to
cast it into type `double` before the division, and then print out the three
statistics we've computed.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Statistics.java[lines=24..28]
----
<.> At this point, we use the mean we've already computed to find the
sample standard deviation. Following the formula for sample standard
deviation, we subtract the mean from each score, square the result, and
add it to a running total. Although the formula for sample standard
deviation uses the bounds 1 to _n_, we
translate them to `0` to `n - 1` because of zero-based array numbering.
<.> Dividing the total by `n - 1` gives the sample variance.
<.> Then, the
square root of the variance is the standard deviation.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Statistics.java[lines=29..38]
----
<.> To find the median, we use our selection sort code.

Note that we have
reused the variable `min` to hold the smallest value found so far,
instead of declaring a new variable such as `smallest`. Some programmers
might object to doing so, since we run the risk of interpreting the
variable as the minimum value in the entire array, as it was before.
Either approach is fine. If you worry about confusing people reading
your code, add a comment.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Statistics.java[lines=39..46]
----
<.> After the array has been sorted, we need to do a quick check to see if
its length is odd or even.
<.> If its length is even, we need to find the average of the two middle elements.
<.> If its length is odd, we can report the value of the single middle element.

Note that some of the statistics we found, such as the maximum, minimum,
or mean, could be computed with a single pass over the data
without the need for an array for storage.
However, the last two tasks need to store all the values to work.
The simplest way to find the sample standard deviation of a list of values
requires its mean, requiring one pass to find the mean and a second
to sum the squares of the difference of the mean and each value.
Likewise, it's impossible to find the median of a list of values without
storing the list.

=== Concepts: Multidimensional lists

In the previous half of the chapter, we focused on lists of data and how
to store them in Java in arrays. The arrays we have discussed already
are _one-dimensional_ arrays. That is, each element in the array has a
single index that refers to it. Given a specific index, an element will
have that index, come before it, or come after it. These kinds of arrays
can be used to solve a huge number of problems involving lists or
collections of data.

Sometimes, the data needs to be represented with more structure. One way
to provide this structure is with a _two-dimensional_ array. You can
think of a two-dimensional array as a table of data. Instead of using a
single index, a two-dimensional array has two indexes. Usually, we think
about these dimensions as rows and columns. Below is a table of
information that gives the distances in miles between the five largest
cities in the United States.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="^.^h,5*^.^",]
|==============================
| | New York | Los Angeles | Chicago | Houston | Phoenix
| New York |0 |2,791 |791 |1,632 |2,457
| Los Angeles |2,791 |0 |2,015 |1,546 |373
| Chicago |791 |2,015 |0 |1,801 |1,181
| Houston |1,632 |1,546 |1,801 |0 |1,176
| Phoenix |2,457 |373 |1,181 |1,176 |0
|==============================

The position of each number in the table is a fundamental part of its
usefulness. We know that the distance from Chicago to Houston is 1,801
miles because that number is in the Chicago row and the Houston column.
A two-dimensional array shares almost all of its properties with a
one-dimensional array. It's still a homogeneous, static data structure
with random access. If the example above were made into a Java array,
the numbers themselves would be the elements of the array. The names of
the cities would need to be stored separately, perhaps in an array of
type `String`.

There's no reason to confine the idea of a two-dimensional list to a
table of values. Many games are played on a two-dimensional grid. One of
the most famous such games is chess. As with so many other things in
computer science, we must come up with an abstraction that mirrors
reality and allows us to store the information inside of a computer. For
chess, we'll need an 8 × 8 two-dimensional array. We can represent
each piece in the board with a `char`, using the encoding given below.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="^,^l"]
|===================
|Piece |Encoding
|Pawn |'P'
|Knight |'N'
|Bishop |'B'
|Rook |'R'
|Queen |'Q'
|King |'K'
|===================

Using uppercase characters for black pieces and lowercase characters
for white pieces, we could represent a game of chess after a classic
king's pawn open by white as shown.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="^.^h,8*^.^l",]
|=======================================================
| | 0 | 1 | 2| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
| 0 |'R' |'N' |'B' |'Q' |'K' |'B' |'N' |'R'
| 1 |'P' |'P' |'P' |'P' |'P' |'P' |'P' |'P'
| 2 | | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |'p' | | |
| 6 |'p' |'p' |'p' |'p' | |'p' |'p' |'p'
| 7 |'r' |'n' |'b' |'q' |'k' |'b' |'n' |'r'
|=======================================================

Observe that, just as with one-dimensional arrays, the indexes for rows
and columns in two-dimensional arrays also use zero-based counting.

After the step from one-dimensional arrays to two-dimensional arrays, it's
natural to wonder if there can be arrays of even higher dimension. We
can visualize a two-dimensional array as a table, but a
three-dimensional array is harder to visualize. Nevertheless, there are
uses for three-dimensional arrays.

Consider a professor who's taking a survey of students in her course.
She wants to know how many students there are in each of three
categories: gender, class level, and major. If she treats each of these
as a dimension and assigns an index to each possible value, she could
store the results in a three-dimensional array. For gender she could
pick male = 0 and female = 1. For class level she could pick freshman =
0, sophomore = 1, junior = 2, senior = 3, and other = 4. Assuming it's
a computer science class, for major she could pick computer science = 0,
math = 1, other science = 2, engineering = 3, and humanities = 4. Using this
system she could compactly store the number of students in any
combination of categories she was interested in. For example, the total
number of female sophomore engineering students would be stored in the
cell with gender index 1, class level index 1, and major index 3.

Three dimensions is usually the practical limit when programming in
Java. If you find an especially good reason to use four or higher
dimensions, feel free to do so, but it should happen infrequently. The
Java language has no set limit on array dimensions, but most virtual
machines have the absurdly high limitation of 255 different dimensions.

=== Syntax: Advanced arrays in Java

Now that we've discussed the value of storing data in multidimensional
lists, we'll describe the Java language features that allow you to do
so. The changes needed to go from one-dimensional arrays to
two-dimensional and higher arrays are simple. First, we'll
describe how to declare, instantiate, and index into two-dimensional
arrays. Then, we'll discuss some of the ways in which arrays (both
one-dimensional and higher) are different from primitive data types.
Next, we'll explain how it's possible to make two-dimensional
arrays in Java where the rows are not all the same length. Finally,
we'll cover some of the most common mistakes programmers make with
arrays.

==== Multidimensional arrays

When declaring a two-dimensional array, the main difference from a
one-dimensional array is an extra pair of brackets. If we wish to
declare a two-dimensional array of type `int` in which we could store
values like the table of distances above, we would do so as follows.

[source,java]
----
int[][] distances;
----

As with one-dimensional arrays, it's legal to put the brackets on the
other side of the variable identifier or, even more bizarrely, have a
pair on each side.

Once the array is declared, it must still be instantiated using the
`new` keyword before it can be used. This time we will use two pairs of
brackets, with the number in the first pair specifying the number of
rows and the number in the second pair specifying the number of columns.

[source,java]
----
distances = new int[5][5];
----

After the instantiation, we will have 5 rows and 5 columns, giving a
total of 25 locations where `int` values can be stored. Indexing these
locations is done by specifying row and column values in the brackets.
So, to fill up the table with the distances between cities given above
we can use the following tedious code.

[source,java]
----
// New York
distances[0][1] = 2791;
distances[0][2] = 791;
distances[0][3] = 1632;
distances[0][4] = 2457;
// Los Angeles
distances[1][0] = 2791;
distances[1][2] = 2015;
distances[1][3] = 1546;
distances[1][4] = 373;
// Chicago
distances[2][0] = 791;
distances[2][1] = 2015;
distances[2][3] = 1801;
distances[1][4] = 1181;
// Houston
distances[3][0] = 1632;
distances[3][1] = 1546;
distances[3][2] = 1801;
distances[3][4] = 1176;
// Phoenix
distances[4][0] = 2457;
distances[4][1] = 373;
distances[4][2] = 1181;
distances[4][3] = 1176;
----

You'll notice that we did not specify values for `distances[0][0]`,
`distances[1][1]`, `distances[2][2]`, `distances[3][3]`, or
`distances[4][4]`, since each of these already has the default value of
`0`.

Much more often, multidimensional array manipulation will use nested
`for` loops. For example, we could create an array with 3 rows and 4
columns, and then assign values to those locations such that they were
numbered increasing across each row.

[source,java]
----
int[][] values = new int[3][4];
int number = 1;
for(int i = 0; i < values.length; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < values[i].length; j++) {
        values[i][j] = number;
        number++;
    }
----

This code would result in an array filled up like the following table.

[.center%autowidth,cols="4*^",]
|=============
|1 |2 |3 |4
|5 |6 |7 |8
|9 |10 |11 |12
|=============

The bounds for the outer `for` loop in this example uses
`values.length`, giving the total number of rows. Then, the inner `for`
loops uses `values[i].length`, which is the length (number of columns)
of the current row. In this case, all the rows of the array have the same
number of columns, but this is not always true, as we'll discuss
later.

==== Reference types

All array variables are _reference_ type variables, not simple values
like most of the types we have discussed so far. A reference variable is
a name for an object. You might recall that we described the difference
between reference types and primitive types in
<<Concepts: Types>>, but the only reference type we've
considered in detail is `String`.

More than one reference variable can point at the same object. When one
object has more than one name, this is called _aliasing_. The `String`
type is immutable, meaning that an object of type `String` cannot change
its contents. Arrays, however, are _mutable_, which means that aliasing
can cause unexpected results. Here is a simple example with
one-dimensional array aliasing.

[source,java]
----
int[] array1 = new int[10];
for(int i = 0; i < array1.length; i++)
    array1[i] = i;
int[] array2 = array1;
array2[3] = 17;
System.out.println(array1[3]);
----

Surprisingly, the value printed out will be `17`. The variables `array1`
and `array2` are references to the same fundamental array. Unlike
primitive values, the complete contents of `array1` are *not* copied to
`array2`. Only one array exists because only one array has been created
by the `new` keyword. When index 3 of `array2` is updated, index 3
of `array1` changes as well, because the two variables are simply two
names for the same array.

[.text-center]
.Two array references pointing to a single array object.
image::array3.svg[scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=75%,width=75%,align="center"]


Sometimes this reference feature of Java allows us to write code that is
confusing or has unexpected consequences. However, the benefit is that
we can assign one array to another without incurring the expense of
copying the entire array. If you create an array with 1,000,000
elements, copying that array several times could get expensive in
terms of program running time.

The best rule of thumb for understanding reference types is that there
is only one actual object for every call to `new`. The primary exception
to this rule is that uses of `new` can be hidden from the user when
they're in method calls.

[source,java]
----
String greeting = new String("Hello");
String pronoun = greeting.substring(0,2);
----

At the end of this code, the reference `pronoun` will point to an object
containing the `String "He"`. The `substring()` method invokes `new`
internally, generating a new `String` object completely separate from
the `String` referenced by `greeting`. This code may look unusual
because we're explicitly using `new` to make a `String` object
containing `"Hello"`. The `String` class is different from every other
class because it can be instantiated without using the `new` keyword.
The line `String greeting = "Hello";` implicitly calls `new` to create an object
containing the `String "Hello"` and functions nearly the same as the
similar line above.

==== Ragged arrays

We're ashamed to say that we've lied to you. In Java, there's no
such thing as a true multidimensional array! Instead, the examples of
two-dimensional and three-dimensional arrays we've given above are
actually arrays of arrays (of arrays). Thinking about multidimensional
arrays in this way can give the programmer more flexibility.

If we return to the definition of the two-dimensional array with 3 rows
and 4 columns, we can instantiate each row separately instead of as a
block.

[source,java]
----
int[][] values = new int[3][];
int number = 1;
for(int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    values[i] = new int[4];
    for(int j = 0; j < values[i].length; j++) {
        values[i][j] = number;
            number++;
    }
}
----

This code is functionally equivalent to the earlier code that
instantiated all 12 locations at once. The same could be done with a
three-dimensional array or higher. We can specify the length of each row
independently, and, more bizarrely, we can give each row a different
length. A multidimensional array whose rows have different lengths is
called a _ragged array_.

A ragged array is usually unnecessary. The main reason to use a ragged
array is to save space, when you have tabular data in which the lengths
of each row vary a great deal. If the lengths of the rows vary only a
little, it's probably not worth the extra hassle. However, if some rows
have 10 elements and others have 1,000,000, the space saved can be
significant.

We can apply the idea of ragged arrays to the table of distances between
cities. If you examine this table, you'll notice that about half the
data in it is repeated, because the distance from Chicago to Los Angeles
is the same as the distance from Los Angeles to Chicago, and so on. We
can store the data in a triangular shape to keep only the unique
distance information.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="^.^h,5*^.^",]
|============================
| | New York | Los Angeles | Chicago | Houston | Phoenix
| New York |0 4+|
| Los Angeles |2,791 |0 3+|
| Chicago |791 |2,015 |0 2+|
| Houston |1,632 |1,546 |1,801 |0 |
| Phoenix |2,457 |373 |1,181 |1,176 |0
|============================

We could create this table in code by doing the following.

[source,java]
----
distances = new int[5][];
// New York
distances[0] = new int[1];
// Los Angeles
distances[1] = new int[2];
distances[1][0] = 2791;
// Chicago
distances[2] = new int[3];
distances[2][0] = 791;
distances[2][1] = 2015;
// Houston
distances[3] = new int[4];
distances[3][0] = 1632;
distances[3][1] = 1546;
distances[3][2] = 1801;
// Phoenix
distances[4] = new int[5];
distances[4][0] = 2457;
distances[4][1] = 373;
distances[4][2] = 1181;
distances[4][3] = 1176;
----

With this table a user cannot simply type in `distances[0][4]` and hope
to get the distance from New York to Phoenix. Instead, we have to be
careful to make sure that the index of the first city is never larger
than the index of the second city. If we're reading in the indexes of
the cities from a user, we can write some code to do this check. Let
`city1` and `city2`, respectively, contain the indexes of the cities the
user wants to use to find the distances between.

[source,java]
----
if(city1 > city2) {
    int temp = city1;
    city1 = city2;
    city2 = temp;
}
System.out.println("The distance is: " + distances[city1][city2] +
    " miles");
----

If we wanted to be even cleverer, we could eliminate the zero entries
from the table, but then the ragged array would have one fewer row than
the original two-dimensional array.

==== Common pitfalls

Even one-dimensional arrays make many new errors possible. Below we list
two of the most common mistakes made with both one-dimensional and
multidimensional arrays.

.Pitfall: Array out of bounds
[WARNING]
====

The length of an array is determined at run time. Sometimes the number is
specified in the source code, but it's always possible for an array to
be instantiated based on user input. The Java compiler doesn't do any
checking to see if you're in the right range. If your program tries to
access an illegal element, it'll crash with an
`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

[source,java]
----
int[] array = new int[100];
for(int i = 0; i <= array.length; i++)
    array[i] = i;
----

Here's a classic example. By iterating through the loop one too many
times, the program will try to store `100` into `array[100]`, when the
last index of the array is `99`. In C and {cpp}, pointer arithmetic
allowed a negative index to be valid for an array in some cases. In
Java, a negative index will always throw an
`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

There are other less common causes for going outside of array bounds.
Imagine that you're scanning through a file that has been redirected to
input, keeping a count of the occurrences of each letter of the alphabet
in the file.

[source,java]
----
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int[] counts = new int[26];
String word;
while(in.hasNext()) {
    word = in.next().toLowerCase();
    for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++)
        counts[word.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
}
----

This segment of code does a decent job of counting the occurrences of
each letter. The `while` loop continues to execute as long as there is
another `String` worth of data to read in the file. The inner `for` loop
iterates through each `char` in the `String` and increments the
appropriate element of the `counts` array. By subtracting the value
`'a'`, we normalize the `char` values `'a'` through `'z'` to `0` through
`25`. However, if there's any punctuation in the file, simply
subtracting `'a'` will not work. The Unicode value of `'.'`, for
example, is 46. The Unicode value of `'a'` is 97. Subtracting 97 from 46
will make this code try to increment index `-51` of the array. An
additional check should be put into this code to make sure that the
`char` value being examined is a letter.

====

.Pitfall: Uninitialized reference arrays
[WARNING]
====

Another problem only comes up with arrays of reference types. Whenever
the elements of an array are primitive data types, memory for that type
is allocated. Whenever the elements of the array are reference types,
only references to objects, initialized to `null`, are allocated. Because
it's an array of primitive values, the following code works fine.

[source,java]
----
int[] primitives = new int[100];
primitives[67]++;
----

The following code, however, will cause a `NullPointerException`.

[source,java]
----
String[] references = new String[100];
int x = references[67].length();
----

Arrays of reference types must initialize each element before using it.
The `NullPointerException` could be avoided as follows.

[source,java]
----
String[] references = new String[100];
for(int i = 0; i < references.length; i++)
    references[i] = new String();
int x = references[67].length();
----

In this case, there would be no error, although
`references[67].length()` would still be `0`, and that's probably not
what the programmer intended.

A similar error can happen with multidimensional arrays.

[source,java]
----
int[][] table = new int[10][];
for(int i = 0; i < table.length; i++)
    table[i][i] = i;
----

Because an array is itself a reference type, the `table` array contains
`10` references to `null` for each of its `10` rows. Unless those rows
are instantiated, the JVM will again throw a `NullPointerException` when
attempting to access an `int` value in the table. This error confuses
many beginner programmers because no reference types appear to be
involved.

====

=== Examples: Two-dimensional arrays

Below we give some examples where two-dimensional arrays can be helpful.
We start with a simple calendar example, move on to matrix and
vector multiplication useful in math, and finish with a game.

.Calendar
====

We're going to create a calendar that can be printed to the terminal to
show which day of the week each day lands on. Our program will prompt
the user for the day of the week the month starts on and for the total
number of days in the month. Our program will print out labels for the
seven days of the week, followed by numbering starting at the
appropriate place, and wrapping such that each numbered day of the month
falls under the appropriate day of the week.

.Prints a calendar for a given month, formatted week by week.
[source, java]
[[CalendarProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Calendar.java[]
----
<1> First, our code creates a 7 × 7 array of type
`String` called `squares`. The array needs 7 rows so that it can start
with a row to label the days and then output up to 6 rows to cover the
weeks. (Months with 31 days span parts of 6 different weeks if they
start on a Friday or a Saturday.) The number of columns corresponds to
the seven days of the week.
<2> Next, we initialize the first row of the
array to abbreviations for each day of the week.
<3> Then, we initialize the
rest of the array to be a single space.
<4> Our program then reads from the user the day the month starts on.
<5> The program also reads from the user for the total number of
days in the month.
<6> The main work of the program is done by the `while` loop, which fills
each square with a steadily increasing day number for each column,
moving on to the next row when a row is filled.
<7> Finally, the two nested `for` loops at the end print out the contents of `squares`, putting a
tab (`'\t'`) between each column and starting a new line for each row.

====

.Matrix-vector multiplication
====

Arrays give a natural way to represent vectors and matrices. In 3D
graphics and video game design, we can represent a point in 3D space as
a vector with three elements: _x_, _y_, and
_z_. If we want to rotate the three-dimensional point
represented by this vector, we can multiply it by a matrix. For example,
to rotate a point around the _x_-axis by
_θ_ degrees, we could use the following matrix.

//[stem]
//++++
//\begin{bmatrix}
//1 & 0 & 0 \\
//0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
//0 & \sin \theta  & \cos \theta \\
//\end{bmatrix}
//++++

[.text-center]
image::matrix.svg[scaledwidth=20%,pdfwidth=20%,width=20%,align="center"]


Given an _m_ × _n_ matrix _A_, let
_A~ij~_ be the element in the _i_^th^ row,
_j_^th^ column. Given a vector _v_ of length
_n_, let _v~i~_ be the _i_^th^
element in the vector. To multiply _A_ by _v_,
we use the following equation to find the _i_^th^ element of
the resulting vector _v′_.

//[stem]
//++++
//v'_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n A_{ij}\cdot v_j
//++++

[.text-center]
image::vector.svg[scaledwidth=20%,pdfwidth=20%,width=20%,align="center"]


By transforming this equation to Java code, we can write a program that
can read in a three-dimensional point and rotate it around the
_x_-axis by the amount specified by the user.

.Uses matrix multiplication to rotate a point in three-dimensional space.
[source, java]
[[MatrixRotateProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/MatrixRotate.java[]
----
<1> This program begins by declaring a array of type `double` to hold the
vector.
<2> Afterward, it reads three values from the user into it.
<3> Then, the program reads in the angle of rotation in degrees and converts it to
radians.
<4> Next, we use the `Math` class to calculate the values in the
rotation matrix. Note that we do not change the values that need to be
zero.
<5> We use a `for` loop to perform the matrix-vector
multiplication. Again, the summing done by
our calculations uses the fact that all elements of `rotatedPoint` are
initialized to `0.0`.
<6> Finally, we print out the answer.

[[ticTacToeExample]]
.Tic-Tac-Toe
====

Almost every child knows the game of tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses.
Its playing area is a 3 × 3 grid. Players take turns placing Xs and Os,
trying to get three in a row. Strategically, it's not the most
interesting game since two players who make no mistakes will always tie.
Still, we present a program that allows two human players to play the
game because the manipulations of a two-dimensional array in the program
are similar to those for more complicated games such as Connect Four,
checkers, chess, or Go. Our program will catch any attempt to play on a
location that has already been played and will determine the winner, if
there is one.

Games often give rise to complex programs, since rules that are
intuitively obvious to humans may be difficult to state explicitly in
Java. Our program begins by setting up quite a few variables and
objects.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/TicTacToe.java[lines=1..13]
----
<.> First, we create a `Scanner` to read in data.
<.> Then, we declare
and instantiate our 3 × 3 playing board as a
two-dimensional array of type `char`.
<.> We want any unplayed space on the
grid to be the `char` for a space, so we fill the array with `' '`.
<.> Next, we declare a `boolean` value to keep track of whose turn it is and
another to keep track of whether the game is over.
<.> Finally, we
declare variables to hold the row, the column, the number of moves that
have been made so far and the current shape (`'X'` or `'O'`).

The core of the game is a `while` loop that runs until `gameOver`
becomes `true`. The first line of the body of this loop is an obscure
Java shortcut often referred to as the _ternary operator_. This line is
really shorthand for the following.

[source,java]
----
if(turn)
    shape = 'X';
else
    shape = '0';
----

The ternary operator works with a condition followed by a question mark
and then two values separated by a colon. If the condition is `true`,
the first value is assigned, otherwise the second value is assigned.
It's perfect for situations like this where one value is needed when
`turn` is `true` and another is needed when `turn` is `false`. The
ternary operator is a useful trick, but it shouldn't be overused.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/TicTacToe.java[lines=15..35]
----
<.> After assigning the appropriate value to `shape`, our code reads in the
row and column values for the current player's next move.
<.> If the row and
column selected correspond to a spot that's already been taken, the
program gives an error message.
<.> Otherwise, the program sets
`board[row][column]` to the appropriate symbol, increments `moves`, and
changes the value of `turn`.
<.> Then, it prints out the board.

Our program doesn't do any bounds checking on `row` and `column`.
If a user tries to place a move at row 5 column 3, our program will try
to do so and crash. Additional clauses in the `if` statement could
be used to add bounds checking.

Perhaps the trickiest part of our tic-tac-toe program is checking for a
win.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/TicTacToe.java[lines=36..62]
----
<.> First we check each row to see if it contains three in a row.
<.> Then, we check each column.
<.> Finally, we check the two diagonals.
<.> If any of
those checks ended the game, we announce a winner.
<.> Otherwise, if the
number of moves has reached 9 with no winner, it must be a tie game.

In
a larger game (such as Connect Four), we would want to find better ways
to automate checking rows, columns, and diagonals. For example, we wouldn't
want to check the entirety of a larger board each move.
Instead, we could focus only on the rows, columns, and diagonals
affected by the last move.

=== Advanced: Special array tools in Java

Arrays are fundamental data structures in many programming languages.
There are often special syntactical tools or libraries designed to make
them easier to use. In this section, we explore two advanced tools, the
enhanced `for` loop and the `Arrays` utility class.


==== Enhanced `for` loops

In <<ch05-repetition#ch05-repetition>> we described three loops: `while`
loops, `for` loops, and `do`-`while` loops. Although these are the only
three loops in Java, there's a special form of the `for` loop designed
for use with arrays (and some other data structures). This construct is
often called the _enhanced `for` loop_.

An enhanced `for` loop does not have the three-part header of a regular `for`
loop. Instead, it's designed to iterate over the contents of an array or other list.
Inside its parentheses is a declaration of a variable with the same type
as the elements of the array, then a colon (`:`), then the name of the
array. Consider the following example of an enhanced `for` loop used to sum the
values of an array of `int` values called `array`. As with all loops in
Java, braces are optional if there's only one executable statement in
the loop.

[source,java]
----
int sum = 0;
for(int value : array)
    sum += value;
----

This code functions in exactly the same way as the traditional `for`
loop we would use to solve the same problem.

[source,java]
----
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
    sum += array[i];
----

The advantage of the enhanced `for` loop is that it's shorter and clearer.
There's also no worry about being off by one with your indexes. The
enhanced `for` loop iterates over every element in the array, no indexes
needed!

Enhanced `for` loops can be nested or used inside of other loops. Consider the
following nested enhanced `for` loops that print out all possible chess
pieces, in both black and white colors.

[source,java]
----
String[] colors = {"Black", "White"};
String[] pieces = {"King", "Queen", "Rook", "Bishop", "Knight", "Pawn"};
for(String color : colors)
    for(String piece : pieces)
        System.out.println(color + " " + piece);
----

Enhanced `for` loops do have a few drawbacks. For one, they're designed for iterating
through an entire array. It's ugly to try to make them stop early, and
it's impossible to make them go back to previous values. They're also
only designed for *read* access, not write access. The variable in the
header of the enhanced `for` loop takes on each value in the array in turn,
but assigning values to that variable has *no effect* on the underlying
array. Consider the following `for` loop that assigns `5` to every value
in `array`.

[source,java]
----
for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
    array[i] = 5;
----

This kind of assignment is impossible in an enhanced `for` loop. The
"`equivalent`" enhanced `for` loop does nothing. It assigns `5` to the local
variable `value` but never changes the contents of `array`.

[source,java]
----
for(int value : array)
    value = 5;
----

While enhanced `for` loops are great for arrays, they can also be used for
any data structure that implements the `Iterable` interface. We
discuss interfaces in <<ch10-interfaces#ch10-interfaces>> and dynamic data
structures in <<ch18-dynamic-data-structures#ch18-dynamic-data-structures>> and
<<ch19-recursion#ch19-recursion>>.

==== The `Arrays` class

The designers of the Java API knew that arrays were important and added
a special `Arrays` class to manipulate them.

This class has a number of static methods that can be used to search for
values in arrays, make copies of arrays, copy selected ranges of arrays,
test arrays for equality, fill arrays with specific values, sort arrays,
convert an entire array into a `String` representation, and more. The
signatures of the methods below are given for `double` arrays, but most
methods are overloaded to work with all primitive types and reference
types.

[.center%header,width=100%,cols="<.<55%l,<.<45%"]
|=======================================================================
|Method |Purpose
|binarySearch(double[] array, double value) |Returns index of `value`
inside `array` or a negative number if it cannot be found. Adding 1 to
the negative number and then negating it will give the index where the
value would have been.  Note: `array` must be sorted for this method to work.

|copyOf(double[] array, int length) |Returns a copy of `array` with
length `length`, either truncated or padded if it doesn't match the
length of `array`.

|copyOfRange(double[] array, int from, int to) |Returns a copy of
`array` from the range starting at `from` and going up to but not
including `to`.

|equals(double[] array1, double[] array2) |Returns `true` if `array1`
and `array2` have the same number of elements, each pair of which is
equal.

|fill(double[] array, double value) |Fills `array` with copies of
`value`.

|sort(double[] array) |Sorts `array` using natural ordering. This
method can fail for `Object` arrays in which the objects are not
comparable.

|toString(double[] a) |Returns a `String` containing representations
of each element separated with commas.
|=======================================================================

Consult the API for more information. Even though tasks like `fill()`
are simple, it's worth using the method from `Arrays` instead of
writing your own. The methods in the Java API have often been tuned for
speed and use special instructions that are not accessible to regular Java
programmers.

=== Solution: Game of Life

Here we present our solution to the Conway's Game of Life simulation.
Our program is designed to run the simulation with 24 rows and 80
columns, although it would be easy to change those dimensions.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Life.java[lines=1..11]
----
<.> The `main()` method of our program starts by defining `ROWS`, `COLUMNS`,
and `GENERATIONS` as named constants using the `final` keyword.
<.> Next, we
create *two* arrays with `ROWS` rows and `COLUMNS` columns. The `board`
array will hold the current generation. The `temp` array will be used to
fill in the next generation. Then, `temp` will be copied into `board`,
and the process will repeat. The `swap` variable is just a reference we'll
use to swap `board` and `temp`.
<.> We randomly fill the board, making
10% of the cells living. Again, you may wish to play with this number to
see how the patterns in the simulation are affected.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Life.java[lines=12..29]
----
<.> The `for` loop at the beginning of this segment of code runs once for
each generation we simulate.
<.> The two nested `for` loops examine each
cell in `board`.
<.> The two `for` loops nested inside of those loops do the
calculations to determine if a cell will be alive or dead in the next
generation. These inner loops start one row before the current row and
finish one row after the current row. They do the same for columns. The
`Math.max()` and `Math.min()` methods are used to keep the loops from
going out of bounds of the array. When backing up a row or a column, the
`Math.max()` methods make sure that we do not generate an index smaller
than 0. When going forward a row or a column, the `Math.min()` methods
make sure that we do not generate an index greater than `ROWS - 1` or
`COLUMNS - 1`.
<.> After these two innermost `for` loops have counted the total of living
cells around the cell in question, we decide the fate of the cell for
the next generation. If the cell's alive and has exactly 2 or 3 living
neighbors, it'll continue to live.
<.> If a cell's dead, it'll
come to life only if it has exactly 3 living neighbors.
<.> After we've
stored the state of each cell in the next generation into `temp`, we
swap `board` and `temp`, using the `swap` variable. We could have thrown
out the old array stored in `board` instead of swapping it with `temp`,
but then we'd have to create a new array for `temp` each time, which
is less efficient.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Life.java[lines=30..44]
----
<.> The first `for` loop in this segment prints 100 blank lines to clear the
screen, as we explained earlier.
<.> The two nested `for` loops print out
the state of the current generation, with a `*` for each living cell and
a blank space for each dead one.
<.> After the output, the code sleeps for
500 milliseconds to give the effect of an animation. We'll discuss
exceptions in general in <<ch12-exceptions#ch12-exceptions>> and give more
information about the `Thread.sleep()` method in <<ch13-concurrency#ch13-concurrency>>.

Although 500 milliseconds
(half a second) is a long delay for animation, the scrolling effect of the screen
makes the pattern of alive and dead cells hard to perceive on a terminal.
Some kind of GUI (such as we discuss in <<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>>) could provide
a more pleasing way to visualize the Game of Life, but drawing arbitrary
patterns on a GUI presents its own difficulties.

****
<<lifeGUIExercise>>

=== Concurrency: Arrays

Arrays are critical to concurrent programming in Java. In
<<ch13-concurrency#ch13-concurrency>>, we'll explain how to
create independent threads of execution, each of which is tied to a
`Thread` object. If you have a dual, quad, or higher core computer, you
might want to use two or four threads to solve a problem, but some
programs can use hundreds. How can you keep track of all those `Thread`
objects? In many cases, you'll hold references to them in an array.

Arrays can also hold large lists of data. It's common for threaded programs
to share a single array which each thread reads and writes to. In this
way, memory costs are kept low because there's only one copy of all the
data. In the simplest case, each thread works on some portion of the
array without interacting with the rest. Even then, how do you assign
parts of the array to the different threads?

We'll assume that each element of the array needs to be processed in
some way. For example, we might want to record whether or not each
`long` in an array is prime or not. If you have _k_ threads
and an array of length _n_ where _n_ happens to
be a multiple of _k_, then it's easy: Each thread gets
exactly _n_/_k_ items to work on. For example, the first
thread will work on indexes 0 through _n_/_k_ - 1, the
second thread will work on indexes _n_/_k_ through
2__n__/_k_ - 1, and so on, with the last thread working
on indexes (_k_
- 1)_n_/_k_ through _n_  - 1. Not every element in the array
will require the same amount of computation, but we often assume that
they do because it can be difficult to guess which elements will take
more time to process.

What if the number of elements in the array is not a multiple of the
number of threads? We still want to assign the work the work as fairly
as possible. New programmers are sometimes tempted to use the same
arithmetic from the case in which the threads evenly divide the length
of the array: Each thread gets ⌊_n_/_k_⌋ (using integer
division) elements, and we stick the last thread with the leftovers. How
bad can that be?

****
<<dividingArraysExercise>>
****


This assignment of work can be very poorly balanced. Consider a case
with 10 threads and 28 pieces of data. ⌊28/10⌋ = 2,
using integer division. Thus, the first nine threads have 2 units of
work to do, but the last thread is stuck with 10! Not only is this
unfair; it's inefficient. The person writing the program probably wants
to minimize the total amount of time needed to finish the job. In this
case, the time from when the first thread starts to when the last thread
finishes is called the task's _makespan_. With this division of work,
the makespan is 10 units of work.

[.text-center]
.Units of work per thread using a naive strategy.
image::split1.svg[scaledwidth=60%,pdfwidth=60%,width=60%,align="center"]


.Fairly assigning work
====

A simple way to fix this problem is to look at the value
_n_ mod _k_, the leftovers when you divide _n_ by
_k_. We want to spread those out over the first few threads.
We know that any remainder will be smaller than _k_. If the
index of the thread (starting at 0, of course) is less than the
remainder, we add an extra element to its work. In this way, 28 units of
work spread over 10 threads will give 3 elements to the first 8 threads
and 2 elements to the rest. Using this strategy, the makespan becomes 3
units of work, a huge improvement over 10. Finding a way to spreading
work across multiple threads to improve efficiency is a form of _load
balancing_, a broad term for dividing work across computing resources.

The program below reads the length of an array and the number of threads from the user and then prints out the amount of work for each one. You should be able to adapt the ideas in it to your own multi-threaded programs in <<ch13-concurrency#ch13-concurrency>>.

=== Exercises
*Conceptual Problems*

. Why can't an array be used to hold an arbitrarily long list of
numbers entered by a user? What are strategies that can be used to
overcome this problem?
. In future chapters, we'll introduce a data structure called a
_linked list_. A linked list is a homogeneous, dynamic data structure
with sequential access (unlike an array, which has random access). You
can instantly jump to any place in an array, but you have to step
through each element of a linked list to get to the one you want, even
if you know its position in the list exactly. On the other hand,
inserting values into the beginning of a linked list can be done in one
step, while an array would need to be resized and have its contents
copied over. List some tasks for which an array would be better than a
linked list and vice versa.
. Given the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
double[] array1 = new double[50];
double[] array2 = new double[50];
for(int i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) {
    array1[i] = i + 1;
    array2[i] = array2.length - i;
}
array2 = array1;
for(int i = 1; i < array1.length; i++)
    array1[i] = array1[i - 1] + array1[i];
----
+
What is the value in `array2[array2.length - 1]` after this code is
executed?
. What error will be caused by the following code, and why?
+
[source,java]
----
String[] array = new String[100];
System.out.println(array[99].charAt(0) +
           " is the first letter of the last String.");
----
. An array of length _n_ in Java typically takes
_n_ times the number of bytes for each element plus an
additional 16 bytes of overhead. Since an `int` uses 4 bytes of storage,
an array of 100 `int` elements would take 416 bytes. Consider the
following three-dimensional array declaration and allocation.
+
[source,java]
----
int[][][] data = new int[10][5][20];
----
+
How many bytes are allocated for this array? Remember that the 16 byte
overhead will occur repeatedly, since Java creates a three-dimensional
array as an array of arrays of arrays.
.  Our original table of city distances allocates
5 · 5 = 25 `int` elements to store all the distances
between the five cities, including repeats. How many `int` elements are
allocated for the triangular, ragged array version of this city distance
table? If we used the normal table style, _n_ cities would
require _n_^2^ `int` elements. How many elements would the
triangular, ragged array version allocate for _n_ cities?
.  [[dividingArraysExercise]] Consider the naive method of dividing
an array of length _n_ among _k_ threads that
was discussed in <<Concurrency: Arrays>>: Each thread gets
⌊_n_/_k_⌋ (rounded down because of integer division) elements,
and the last thread gets any extras. What mathematical expression
describes how many extra elements are allocated to the last thread? Can
you come up with an example in which the last element gets *all* the
elements? What should have happened in this case using the other, more
fair scheme for assigning the data to threads?

*Programming Practice*

.  [[wordSearchPunctuationExercise]] In <<wordSearchExample>>,
our code would not count `ship,` as an occurrence of `ship` because of the
comma.
+
Rewrite the code from <<wordSearchExample>> to remove
punctuation from the beginning and end of a word. Use a loop that runs
as long as the character at the beginning of a word is not a letter,
replacing the word with a substring of itself that does not include the
first character. Use a second loop to remove non-letters from the end of
a word. Be careful to stop if the length of the `String` becomes 0, as
with text that's entirely composed of non-letters.
.  [[wordBinarySearchExercise]] In <<wordSearchExample>>, we
wrote a program that counts the occurrences of each word from a list
within a text. If the list of words to search within is long, it can
take quite some time to search through the entire list. If the list of
words were sorted, we could do a trick that would allow us to search
much faster. We could play a "`high-low`" game, searching through the
list by checking the middle word in the array. If that word's too late
in the alphabet, repeat the search on the first half of the list. If it's
too early in the alphabet, repeat the search on the second half of
the list. By repeatedly dividing the list in half, until you either find
the word you're looking for or narrow your search down to a single
incorrect word, you can search much faster. This kind of searching is
called _binary search_ and uses around log _n_ comparisons
to find an element in a list of _n_ items. In contrast, looking through the list one
element at a time takes about _n_ comparisons.
+
Rewrite the code from <<wordSearchExample>> to use binary
search, after applying selection sort from <<selectionSortExample>>. Although selection sort will take some extra time, you should
more than make up the difference with such a fast search. To implement
binary search, keep variables for the start, middle, and end of the
list. Keep adjusting the three variables until the middle index has the
word you are looking for or the start and end variables reach each other. Remember to
use the `compareTo()` method from the `String` class to compare words.
. [[modeExercise]] In <<statisticsExample>>, we gave a program that finds the
maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, and median of a list of
values. Another statistic that is sometimes important is the _mode_, or
most commonly occurring element. For example, in the list
{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 10}, the mode is 3. Write a
program that can determine the mode of a given list of `int` values. A
list can have multiple modes if more than one element occurs with
maximum frequency. For our purposes, we'll consider any list with
multiple modes to have no modes. You may wish to sort the list before
starting the process of counting the frequency of each value.
. [[connectFourExercise]] We used the example of tic-tac-toe in
<<ticTacToeExample>> because a more complex game would have
taken too much space to solve. The game of Connect Four (or the
Captain's Mistress, as it was originally called) pits two players
against each other on a 6 × 7 vertical board. One
player uses red checkers while the other uses black. The two players
take turns dropping their checkers into columns of the board in which
the checkers will drop to the lowest empty row, due to gravity. The goal
of the game is to be the first to make four in a row of your color.
+
Implement a version of Connect Four for two human players, similar to
our version of tic-tac-toe. Many of the ideas are the same,
but the details are more complicated. First, a player will only choose a
particular column. Your program must then find which row a checker
dropped into that column will fall to. Then, the process of counting
four in a row is more difficult than the three in a row of tic-tac-toe.
You will need more loops to automate the process fully.
. [[lifeGUIExercise]] Once you've mastered the material in
<<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>>, adapt the
solution to Conway's Game of Life from <<Solution: Game of Life>>
to display on a graphical user interface. You can use a
`GridLayout` to arrange a large number of `JLabel` objects in a grid and
update their background colors to `Color.BLACK` and `Color.WHITE` as
needed, using the `setBackground()` method. (To make these colors
visible, you will also need to call the `setOpaque()` method once on
each `JLabel` with an argument of `true`.) The Game of Life is much more
compelling with a real GUI instead of an improvised command line
representation.

*Experiments*

. Creating arrays with longer and longer lengths requires more
processor time, since all of those elements must be initialized to
some default value. Using an OS `time` command, determine the amount of
time it takes to create an `int` array of length 10, 10,000, and
10,000,000. In all likelihood, the amount of time that instantiation of
the array takes is a small part of the program, and you should see very
little difference in those three times. However, time is not the only
important resource. When you run a JVM, it has a default heap size that
limits the amount of space you can use to create new objects, including
arrays. When you exceed this size, your program will crash with an
`OutOfMemoryError`. Experiment with different sizes of arrays until you
can estimate the size of your heap within 5MB or so.
+
This estimate will be very rough, since the JVM uses other memory in the
background. For a more accurate picture, you can use the
`Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()` method to determine the maximum JVM
memory size and the
`Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory()` method to determine the total JVM
memory being used.
. Run the implementation of the word search program using the binary
search improvement from <<wordBinarySearchExercise>>. Use the OS
`time` command to time the difference between the regular and binary
search versions of the program with a long list of words. You may see
very little difference on small input, but you can easily find a list of
the 1,000 most commonly used words in English on the Internet along with
long, copyright free texts from
http://www.gutenberg.org[Project Gutenberg^]. Combining these two into a single input
should see a significant increase in speed for the binary search version
relative to the regular version.
. Generate input files consisting of 1,000,
10,000, and 100,000 random `int` values.
Time our implementation of selection sort from
<<selectionSortExample>> running on each of these input files
and redirecting output to output files. What's the behavior of the
running time as the input length increases by a factor of 10? As a
function of _n_, how many times total does the body of the inner
`for` loop run during selection sort? Does this function closely
mirror the increase in running time?
