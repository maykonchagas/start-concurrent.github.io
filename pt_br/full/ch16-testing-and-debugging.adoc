=== Fixing bugs

This chapter is about finding, fixing, and preventing
bugs in software. Within this book, this chapter is unique in that it's not based
on concrete problems with straightforward solutions. Finding
and fixing bugs in software, especially concurrent
software, is a problem no one's solved completely. The first
half of this chapter will focus on common bugs and how to fix them. The
second half will focus on design techniques for preventing bugs and
testing techniques for finding bugs hidden in your code.

==== Common sequential bugs

We'll begin with bugs commonly found in sequential programs, some of
which have been mentioned in previous chapters as common mistakes.
We won't discuss syntax errors or any other errors which
can be caught at compile time. Instead, all bugs discussed in this
chapter are run-time bugs.

There's an infinite number of possible bugs, so they can't all be
listed. Below are a few of the most common categories of bugs to affect
beginner (and occasionally veteran) programmers.

Precision Errors:::
  Floating-point numbers have limited precision inside of a computer.
  Programs that assume infinite precision might break when real results
  are slightly larger or smaller than expected.
Overflow and Underflow:::
  The cousin of limited precision in floating-point types is the
  limited range of values that integer types can take on. If a value
  goes too high, it wraps back around and becomes a negative number. If
  a value becomes too low, the opposite can happen.
Casting Errors:::
  Casting can have many subtle effects in a program. Sometimes
  programmers divide two integers and forget that the result is an
  integer. Incorrectly casting objects can also lead to a
  `ClassCastException`.
Loop Errors:::
  Loops are a favorite place for bugs to hide. Three of the most common
  loop mistakes are:
  * Off-by-one errors: The loop executes one more or one fewer time than
  expected.
  * Infinite loop: A classic. The loop continues executing until the
  program runs out of memory or a user stops the program externally.
  * Zero loop: The loop doesn't execute even once, though the
  programmer expected it to.
Equivalence Testing Errors:::
  If a programmer uses the `==` operator to compare two references, it
  will be true only if the two references point at the same object.
  Instead, the `equals()` method should usually be used to compare the
  attributes of the objects pointed at by the references.
Array Errors:::
  Arrays are often involved with loop errors. Two problems specific to
  arrays are:
  * Out of bounds: A math mistake or an off-by-one error could lead to
  an attempt to access an element of an array that comes before index 0 or
  after the last index.
  * Uninitialized object arrays: Arrays of primitive data types can be
  created and used immediately; however, arrays of object types are filled
  with `null` values until each element is assigned an object, often a new
  object.
Scope Errors:::
  Some errors can be caused by a programmer's misunderstanding about the
  visibility of a variable.
  * Shadowing variables: If a local variable is declared with the same
  name as a field or class variable, changes within a method will be
  made to that local variable. This principle is straightforward, but
  if a programmer doesn't notice the shadow declaration, the behavior
  of the code can be very confusing.
  * Reference vs. value: When primitive data is passed as an argument
  into a method, its value is copied into the method, and the original
  data is unchanged. When an object is passed as an argument into a
  method, the reference is unchanged, but methods called on the object
  can still affect it.
Null Pointer Errors:::
  By this point in your programming experience, you've almost
  certainly experienced a `NullPointerException`. This last kind of bug is,
  in many ways, a catch-all category because a null reference is generally
  not due to a simple typographical error. In the simplest case, a reference
  simply hasn't been initialized with some default constructor, but more often
  there's a logical error in the design of the code.

=== Concepts: Approaches to debugging

When you've discovered the existence of a bug, pinning down its cause
can be difficult. There are a number of different techniques that are
useful for narrowing down the possible problems.

==== Assertions

A common cause of program errors is an incorrect assumption by a
programmer. A programmer can assume that the user will only enter
positive numbers, that a library call won't throw any exceptions, or
that a linked list is never empty. Some assumptions are reasonable, but
it's important to make sure that they're correct.

Using _assertions_ is a way to check some of your assumptions, often
those surrounding a method call. In most languages, an assertion tests a
condition. If that condition is true, nothing happens, but if it's
false, the program shuts down or an error or exception is thrown. Using
assertion statements is particularly important with methods because you
want to be sure that both your input and output are in the ranges you
expect them to be.

Java supports assertions natively, as we'll discuss in the next
section. However, virtually every language allows you to create your own
assertions should they not be present as a language construct.

==== Print statements

Computer programs execute quickly. Even if they executed a million times
slower, no human is sensitive enough to decipher the flow of
electrons inside the processor as a program executes. The simple truth
is that we have no idea what's really happening when our programs execute. We
believe that we understand our programs well, and the output usually
confirms that our programs are doing what we imagine they should be doing.

If the output doesn't match our expectations, we might not have enough
data to understand the problem. As long as there have been programmers, they
have been printing out additional debug information to find their
errors. This technique can go a step beyond simple assertion statements
because you can print out the values of the variables rather than just
test to see if they're in a range.

Once you've found the error in your code, it can be tedious to remove
all of your debug statements. Some programmers use a special print
command that can be turned off using a global variable or compiler
option. Others send their output to `stderr` so that it doesn't
interfere with the legitimate output of the program. Much depends upon
the system, the language, and the individual tastes of the programmer.

==== Step-through execution

With the rise of modern debugging environments, using print statements
has lost some of its appeal. Most languages allow the programmer to run
his or her program in a special debug mode where it's possible to
execute a single line of code at a time. These tools usually give the
option of stepping over method calls or stepping into them on a case by
case basis.

As the program executes, the programmer can inspect the values of the
variables in the code. This method of debugging is excellent because it
allows the programmer to watch the execution of the code at whatever
pace he or she desires. Pinpointing problems becomes trivial if you know
which variables you need to watch.

Despite the power of this technique, it has critics. Some older
programmers look down on these tools because they make new
programmers lazier and, in some cases, less careful about writing code
correctly in the first place. It should be noted that step-through
execution modes are not available for every language or for every
system. Some embedded software or operating system programming cannot be
debugged on the real hardware in this way. Of course, most of these
systems can be run in virtual environments that do allow step-through
debugging.

Even when step-through debugging is available, there are difficulties
that can limit its effectiveness. If the bug occurs sporadically,
perhaps due to race conditions, a programmer might not know where to start
looking. Certain data structures such as the `list` template in {cpp} might
not be easily traversable using the inspection facilities of the
debugger. Likewise, the bug or the source of the unexplained behavior
could be buried in library code. The debugger doesn't always have
access to library code for stepping through.

==== Breakpoints

Breakpoints are a feature of step-through debuggers designed to make
them easier to use. A user can specify a particular line of code (with
some restrictions) as being a place where the debugger should pause
execution. Debuggers typically rely on at least one breakpoint in order
to skip all the preliminary parts of the code and skip straight to the
perceived trouble spot.

Sometimes an error will crop up predictably after many thousands of
iterations of a loop or unpredictably due to race conditions or user input.
For either of these cases, conditional breakpoints can be used to save the
a programmer a great deal of time.
Rather than always pausing execution on a given line, a conditional
breakpoint will only pause if a certain condition is met.

=== Syntax: Java debugging tools

==== Assertions

As we mentioned before, many languages have assertions as a built-in
language construct. In Java, there are two forms this feature takes. The
simpler can be done by typing the following.

[source,java]
----
assert condition;
----

In this case, `condition` is a `boolean` value that's expected to be true
for the program to function properly. The more complicated form of the
feature can be used as follows.

[source,java]
----
assert condition : value;
----

This form adds a value that can be attached to the assertion to give the
user more information about the problem. This value can be any primitive
data type, any object type, or a statement that evaluates to one of the
two.

If you've never used an `assert` statement before, you might want to
test it out by forcing an assertion to fail. You might try the following.

[source,java]
----
int x = 5;
assert (x < 4) : "x is too large!";
----

Then, if you compile your program and run it through the JVM, you'll
be shocked when *absolutely nothing happens*. Actually, some of you with
older Java compilers might have heard complaints when you tried to
compile this code. If you have a Java 1.3 compiler or earlier, it'll treat
`assert` like an identifier. Some old Java 1.4 compilers might also give
warnings or require special flags to compile. However, if you
have an up-to-date compiler, the problem is that the JVM must have
assertions enabled at run time. Assertions are intended to be a special
debugging tool and ignored otherwise. To turn run program
`AssertionTest` with assertions enabled, type the following.

....
java -ea AssertionTest
....

With this option, an exception should be thrown at run time.

....
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: x is too large!
....

If you're using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you'll need to enable
assertions on the run configuration for the program, usually by putting `-ea`
in the field for JVM arguments. There are other options allowing you to
enable or disable assertions for specific packages or classes.

****
<<assertExercise>>
****

Now that you know how to use assertions, you need to know when they're
a good idea. The https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html[Java Tutorials^]
on the https://www.oracle.com[Oracle^] website suggest five situations
where assertions are useful: internal invariants,
control-flow invariants, preconditions for methods, postconditions for
methods, and class invariants. _Internal invariants_ are those
situations when you assume that reaching a certain place in your code,
like the `else` branch of an `if` statement, will force a variable to
have a certain value. For internal invariants, you assert that the
variable has the expected value. A _control-flow invariant_ means that
you assume that your code will always execute along a certain path. For
control-flow invariants, you assert `false` if the JVM reaches a point
in the code you expected it never would. _Method preconditions_ are
those conditions you expect to be true about the state of objects or the
input to a method before the method is called.

The philosophy of Java is that `public` methods should _not_ have
assertions used to test their preconditions. Instead, illegal input
values for a `public` method should cause exceptions to be thrown, so
that improper usage can always be dealt with. In contrast, _method
postconditions_ are the states that various variables and objects should
have at the end of a method call. Using assertions to check these values
is fine, since they reflect an error on the part of whoever wrote the
method. _Class invariants_ are conditions about the state of every
instance of a class that should be true as long as the class is in a
consistent state. Perhaps a method call rearranges the innards of an
object, but by the end of the method call, the object should be
consistent again. You should use assertions to check class invariants at
the end of every method that could make the object violate these
invariants.

Wonderful as assertions are, there are times when they shouldn't be
used. The key danger of assertions is that they're usually turned off.
Thus, any statement that's part of an assertion must not have
side-effects that are necessary for the normal operation of the program.
For example, imagine you have an object called `bacteria` that
mutates periodically. The mutation returns `true` if successful and
`false` if there was an unexpected error. You should *not* test for that
failure inside an assert, as follows.

[source,java]
----
assert bacteria.mutate() : "Mutation failed!";
----

With assertions disabled, the entire assertion is skipped, and the 
`bacteria` object won't mutate.
Instead, your assertion should test only the result of the computation.

[source,java]
----
boolean success = bacteria.mutate();
assert success : "Mutation failed!";
----

As stated above, checking for bad input coming into `public` methods
shouldn't be done with assertions because turning off assertions will
remove your error checking.

==== Print statements

Print statements are one of the most time-honored methods of debugging
and remain a quick, dirty, yet effective means of finding errors. Java
does not provide any special tools to make print statements easier to
use for debugging. Some purists might argue that this kind of
debugging which focuses on progressively narrowing down the location of a
problem until the bad assumption, logical mistake, or typographical error
can be found should be done only with assertions.

Nevertheless, there are a few tips to make print statements a better
debugging tool in Java. The first is the use of `System.err`. By now,
you've used `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()` so many
times that you're probably tired of them. Any output method that can be
used with `System.out` can also be used with `System.err`. For example,
there's a `System.err.print()` and a `System.err.println()` method. If
you simply run a program from the command line and watch the output, you
should see no difference between using `System.out` and `System.err`.
However, if you redirect the output of your program to a file using the
`>` operator, only the `System.out` code will be sent to the file.
Anything printed with `System.err` will be sent to the screen.
Alternatively, you can redirect `System.err` to a file by using the `2>`
operator. Using `System.err` makes it easier to separate legitimate
output from error messages, but it also makes it easier to comment out
your debug code by doing a find and replace.

A more extensive method for using print statements to debug is by
defining your own class for printing. Every method in it can call a
corresponding method in `System.out` or `System.err`. You can define a
`boolean` value at the class level that determines whether or not
methods in your debug printing class print or stay silent. When you want
to change from debugging to your production or retail version of the
code, you can simply switch this value to `false`.

A "`modernized`" method of using print statements is creating a simple
GUI instead. In preparing materials for this textbook, we were
occasionally frustrated by the fact that multiple threads can interfere
with each other while printing on the screen: You can't always tell
which thread is printing which characters. By displaying the output of
each thread in separate `JTextArea` or `JLabel` components on a simple GUI,
you can disentangle the output of each thread.

==== Step-through debugging in Java

Since the Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs are so widely used,
we're going to review the step-through debugging features of each
environment. Similar tools are available with other IDEs and for most
languages.

===== Eclipse

In Eclipse, you can set set breakpoints either by right clicking or double clicking
on the shaded bar immediately to the left of the line you're interested in or by
selecting Toggle Breakpoint from the Run menu.  If you try to set a breakpoint
on an empty or ineligible line of code, Eclipse will set it on the next legal
one.

To debug a program in
Eclipse, right click on the file you wish to run in the Package Explorer
and select Debug As Java Application. If your program's already set up
to run, you can simply click the Debug button in the toolbar. Whenever
you hit a breakpoint, Eclipse will switch to the Debug perspective if it's
not already there.

Once execution is suspended on a breakpoint, you
can use the commands Resume, Step Into, Step Over, and Step Return,
either from the Run menu or from the toolbar. The Resume command (or F8)
allows the program to continue execution, until it hits another
breakpoint. The Step Into command (or F5) advances the execution of the program
by one statement, moving into a method is there is a method call. The
Step Over command (or F6) also advances the execution of the program by one
statement, but it skips over method calls. The Step Return (or F7) command
advances the execution of the program to the end of the current method
and returns, popping the current method off the stack. In the Run menu,
there's also a useful Run to Line command, which will run code until
execution reaches the line where your cursor is.

By right-clicking on a breakpoint in Eclipse, you can access its
properties. Though properties, you can specify that a breakpoint only
halts execution when a specific condition is true or only for a specific
thread. Eclipse also provides variable watch and inspection options. Simply by hovering
over a variable, its type and value are displayed. You can also inspect
an object and traverse its fields. The Variables pane will show the values
of local variables, and the Breakpoints pane will show active and inactive
breakpoints.

The Debug pane will show a view of the stack for each thread.  By moving up
and down the stack, the local variables will change depending on which method
call you're currently inside of.  By default, the method call displayed will
be wherever code most recently executed, but it's useful to jump back to the
method that called the current method (and the method that called that, and so
on) to better understand the overall state of the program and why the current
method call has the parameters that it does.

===== IntelliJ

The debugging facilities provided by IntelliJ are similar to those found
in Eclipse, and many developers prefer them.  You can click in the space to
the left of a line of code to set or remove a breakpoint, and you can edit its
properties with a right-click.

You can start your program running in debug mode by clicking
the Debug button on the toolbar or selecting Debug (Shift+F9) from the Run
menu.  When execution of your program reaches a breakpoint and pauses, you
can use essentially the same tools to advance execution as you would in Eclipse.

The Resume Program command (or F9) will continue execution.  The Step Into
command (or F7) will advance execution by one line, moving into a method call
if there is one. IntelliJ also has a Smart Step Into command (or Shift+F7) that
allows you to pick which method call to step into if there's more than one on
the next line.  The Step Over command (or F8) advances execution by one line
but does not move into a method call.  The Step Out command (or Shift+F8)
returns from the current method.  IntelliJ also has a Run to Cursor command
that will try to execute code until reaching the line where your cursor is.
All of these commands can be found in the Run menu, and the most common ones
appear on toolbars. 

In addition, IntelliJ has "`force`" versions of most of these commands which
step over a line of code, step into a method call, or run to your cursor,
ignoring breakpoints that might pause execution.

IntelliJ has a Frames pane similar to the Debug pane in Eclipse.  It allows
the user to select a given thread and jump to different method calls in the
stack for that thread.  Likewise, IntelliJ has a Variables pane that shows the
state of the local variables for the current method call.  One of the features
that developers like the most about IntelliJ is that it displays the values that
variables have on each line where they're used.  In other words, a line of code
that adds variables `x` and `y` will display their values off to the side of the
line of code, updating the display each time the line's executed.

==== Examples

Experience is often the difference between a good programmer and a bad
programmer. Having seen a bug before means you know to expect it in
the future. Don't be discouraged if it takes hours to find a bug and squash it. 
Although that time is stressful, spending hours poring over your program makes
you better at reading code, a skill just as valuable as writing code. And when
you've spent hours trying to fix a simple mistake, you're unlikely to make the
same mistake again. To make it easier to spot some of these mistakes, we give a
few examples corresponding to the common bugs listed in <<Fixing bugs>>.

.Precision errors
====

Floating-point precision can cause subtle errors.
Here's an example of a program attributed to Cleve Moler that gives
some estimation of the threshold for floating-point precision. Note that
`a` ≈ 4/3, making `b` ≈ 1/3, `c`
≈ 1, and `d` ≈ 0. Nevertheless,
the comparison `d == 0.0` in the `if` statement in this code will
evaluate to `false`.

[source,java]
----
double a = 4.0 / 3.0;
double b = a - 1;
double c = b + b + b;
double d = c - 1;
System.out.println(d);
if(d == 0.0)
	System.out.println("Success!");
----

The output for this fragment is `-2.220446049250313E-16`, and it would be
much worse with `float` variables. Computer scientists who specialize in
numerical analysis have tricks for minimizing the amount of floating-point
error introduced, but awareness is an easy solution to these kinds of bugs.
When testing for specific values of a floating-point number, it's wise to
test for a range rather than a single value. For example, the condition
`d == 0.0` could be replaced by `Math.abs(d) < 0.000001`.

====

.Overflow and underflow
====

As you know, the `int` and `long` types have limited bits for
storage. If an arithmetic operation pushes the value of an `int`
variable larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the variable will come full
circle and become a negative number, usually with a large magnitude. The
converse happens when a variable is pushed lower than the smallest value
it can hold. These situations are called overflow and underflow,
respectively, and Java throws no exceptions when they occur. Programmers
who deal with large magnitude values in `int` or `long` types get used
to underflow and overflow, and when unexpected values are output by
their programs, they're usually quick to pin down the problem variable.

Overflow and underflow can cause more surprising bugs when programmers
forget the sharply limited range of values for `byte` and `char` types. For
example, a curious beginner programmer might want to print out a table
of all of the possible values for `char`. Perhaps the programmer has
forgotten the range of values a `char` can take and is stumped when
the following loop does not terminate.

[source,java]
----
for(char letter = '\0'; letter < 100000; letter++)
    System.out.print(letter);
----

Each time `letter` reaches `Character.MAX_VALUE` which is `'\uFFFF'` or
`65535` as a numerical value, the next increment pushes its value back
to 0. These kinds of errors with `byte` and `char` values are most
common when they're being used as numbers. Some
possibilities are cryptography, low level file operations, and manipulation
of multimedia data. The best solution is care and attention. It can help
to store the values in variables with more bits such as `int` or `long`
values, but care must still be taken to ensure that these values are
within the appropriate range before storing them back into variables
with a smaller number of bits.

For example, color values in many image formats are stored as red, green
blue values with a `byte` used for each of the three colors. In this
system, the darkest color, black, is represented as `(0,0,0)`, zero
values for each of the three `byte` values. At the same time, the lightest
color, white, is represented conceptually as `(255,255,255)`. In
principle, we can perform a simple filter to increase contrast and
lightness by doubling all the pixel values. Given red, green, and
blue color values stored in three `byte` variables called `red`,
`green`, and `blue`, a naive implementation of this filter might be as
follows.

[source,java]
----
red *= 2;
green *= 2;
blue *= 2;
----

In Java, this code would not function correctly. The first problem is that, even
though image standards are written with color values between 0 and 255,
Java `byte` values are *signed*. The web standard for the color purple
has red, green, and blue values of `(128,0,128)`. Since Java `byte`
values are signed, printing the `byte` values for each component of
purple directly will actually print `(-128,0,-128)`. Multiplying the
green value by 2 still gives 0. However, multiplying -128 by 2 as a
`byte` value is -256 which underflows back to 0. Thus, "`brightening`"
purple actually turns it into `(0,0,0)`, black. Properly applying the
filter to a `byte` requires a conversion to the `int` type, masking out
the sign bit, scaling by 2, capping the values at 255, and then casting
back into a `byte`. Despite the complicated description, the code is not
too unwieldy.

[source,java]
----
// Bitwise AND automatically upcasts to int
red = (byte)Math.min(255, 2*(red & 0xFF));
green = (byte)Math.min(255, 2*(green & 0xFF));
blue = (byte)Math.min(255, 2*(blue & 0xFF));
----

====

.Casting errors
====

The previous example about scaling color component values shows one of the
dangers of casting. Someone can easily forget that the implicit cast to
convert a `byte` to an `int` always uses a signed conversion. Likewise, the
explicit cast needed to store an `int` into a `byte` will cheerfully convert
any arbitrarily large `int` into a `byte`, even though the final value might
not be expected by the programmer.

Many other casting errors commonly crop up. The most classic example
might be muddling floating-point and integer types.

[source,java]
----
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
double value = 2.0*(x/y);
----

Above, it's easy for a programmer to forget that the division of `x`
and `y` is integer division. After all, the `2.0` is right there,
causing an implicit cast to `double`. Of course, this cast happens *after*
the division, and the answer stored into `value` is `2.0` and not the
`3.3333333333333335` that the programmer might have expected.

Newer programmers sometimes forget that an explicit cast from a floating-point
type to an integer type always uses truncation, never rounding.

[source,java]
----
int three = (int)2.99999;
----

This assignment will always store `2` into `three`. The `Math.round()`
method or some other additional step is needed to perform rounding.

Casting errors are not limited to primitive data types. Object casting
will be discussed at length in <<ch17-polymorphism#ch17-polymorphism>>. The
biggest danger there is an incorrect explicit upcast.

[source,java]
----
Fruit snack = new ChiliPepper();
Apple apple = (Apple)snack;
----

In a botanical sense, a chili pepper is indeed a fruit and its parallel
Java class is apparently a child of the `Fruit` class. For some reason,
the programmer thought that the only `Fruit` that would be pointed at by
a `snack` reference would be of type `Apple`. Instead of a mouth on
fire, the programmer gets a `ClassCastException`. This two line example
is so simple that it should never come up in serious programming. A much
more common example is an array or linked-list whose contents have a type
that's the parent class of the item you generally expect to be stored. If a large
team is working on a body of code with such a list, half of the
team might expect the list to contain only `Apple` objects while the
other expected only `ChiliPepper` objects. The use of generics,
discussed in <<ch18-dynamic-data-structures#ch18-dynamic-data-structures>>,
can reduce the number of casting errors of this kind, but some applications require a
list to hold many different types with a common superclass. In those
cases, some amount of explicit (and therefore dangerous) casting will
usually be necessary when retrieving objects.

====

Loops give Java much of its expressive power, which includes the power to
express incorrect code. Here are examples of a few of the most common loop
errors.

.Off-by-one errors
====

Computer scientists often use zero-based counting. This departure from
"`normal`" practices is just one source of loops that iterate one time
more or less than they should. If you want to iterate _n_ times, a good
rule of thumb is to start at 0 and to go up to *but not including* _n_.
Alternatively, if you have a reason not to be zero-based, you can start
at 1 and go up to *and including* _n_.

[source,java]
----
for(int i = 1; i < 50; i++)
	System.out.println("Question " + i + ".");
----

Perhaps you want to make a template for an exam. Instead of being
zero-based, you start at 1 because most exams don't have a Question 0.
Unfortunately, you've gotten so used to using strictly less than for
your ending condition that you forget to change it and only get 49
questions printed out. If your purpose was making an exam, you could
catch your mistake and move on. If you're writing a program that
dispenses a quantity of heart medication into a patient's IV in a
hospital, one iteration too few or too many could cause the patient to
get too little of the drug to make a difference or too much of the drug
to be safe.

Input is another tricky area when it comes to being off by one.

[source,java]
----
int i = 0;
double sum = 0;
int count = 0;
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
while(i >= 0) {
    sum += i;
    System.out.print("Enter an integer (negative to quit): ");
    i = scanner.nextInt();
    count++;
}
System.out.println("Average: " + (sum / count));
----

This fragment of code appears to be a perfectly innocent loop that finds
the average of the numbers entered by a user. The loop uses a sentinel
value so that the user simply enters a negative number when all the
numbers have been entered. The value of `sum` is updated before the user
enters a value; thus, the harmless `0` from the declaration of `i` is
included but the final negative number entered to leave the loop is not.
Unfortunately, the value of `count` is incremented for every turn of the
loop, even the extra one for the negative number. To combat this
problem, an `if` statement could be used inside of the loop or `count`
could simply be initialized to `-1`. The mistake is a simple one, but it
doesn't jump out at you unless you trace a few executions. What's most
insidious is that the error is going to be small, especially for large
sets of input numbers. Catching this kind of bug will be discussed more
throughly in the second half of this chapter which deals with testing.

====

.Infinite loops
====

Infinite loops come in many different flavors, from the `char` overflow
example earlier to traversing a linked-list which has a cycle in it.
Many infinite loops are caused by simple typographical errors. Perhaps
the most classic is:

[source,java]
----
int i = 1;
while(i <= 100);
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
----

It's usually a beginning programmer who leaves a semicolon at the end of
the `while` header, but even veterans can get overly enthusiastic
about semicolons. Often a programmer confronted with such a bug (which
causes no output, in this case) will scour the body of the loop without
carefully scrutinizing the condition. An extra semicolon at the end of
a `for` loop header will usually cause an error but will usually *not*
cause an infinite loop.

[source,java]
----
public double average(int[] array) {
    double sum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
        count++;
        if(i == 0)
            i--;
    }
    return sum / count;
}
----

This example might be too absurd to appear in a
textbook, but nearly everyone has written worse code while learning to
program. We could suppose that this method is meant to average the
values in an array, but for some reason, zero valued entries are not to
be counted. The student probably meant to have the following `if`
statement.

[source,java]
----
        if(array[i] == 0)
            count--;
----

Those two small changes turn the method into a working but slightly
inelegant solution. When debugging remember that index variables in
`for` loops can get changed in the body of the loop and change the
expected behavior. Generally, it's a bad idea to change the value of an
index variable anywhere other than the header of a `for` loop, but there
are times when doing so gives the cleanest solution.

Many loop errors are caused by a bad header. Getting the inequality
backward or switching increment and decrement will usually make a loop
that runs a very long time or not at all. We'll see the second
possibility just a little later.

[source,java]
----
for(i = 10; i > 0; i++)
	System.out.println(i + "!");
	
System.out.println("Blast-off!");
----

In this case, the programmer clearly wanted to count *down* from 10 to
1, but after so much incrementing, he or she forgot to make `i`
decrement. As a result, the value of `i` increases for a very long (but
not infinite) time, until it overflows.

====

.Zero loops
====

On the other end of the spectrum, a bad condition can make a loop
execute zero times on `for` and `while` loops. For some input, doing so
might be intended behavior. In other cases, no input will ever cause the
loop to execute.

[source,java]
----
int i = 0;
double sum = 0;
int count = -1;
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
while(i > 0) {
    sum += i;
    System.out.print("Enter an integer (negative to quit): ");
    i = scanner.nextInt();
    count++;
}
System.out.println("Average: " + (sum / count));
----

We've returned to our earlier example of averaging a set of
numbers input by the user. This time we've initialized `count` to be -1
to avoid the off-by-one error, but we've also changed the inequality
of the `while` loop from greater than or equal to strictly greater. As a
consequence, the loop is never entered because 0, the initial
value of `i`, is too small.

[source,java]
----
public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(n % i == 0)
            return false;
    }
	return true;
}
----

Here's a simple method intended to test the number `n` for primality.
Unfortunately, the programmer started the index `i` at 1 instead of 2.
As a consequence, this loop will only run once before finding that any
number is divisible by 1. True, this is not a loop that executes zero
times, but only once is still just as wrong.

[source,java]
----
public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
    for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if(n % i == 0)
            return false;
        else
            return true;
    }
}
----

This example is similar code trying to solve the same problem.
Again, the loop only runs once because the programmer forgot that
finding a single case when a number is not evenly divisible by another
number does not make it prime: a large range of possible factors must be
checked before we can be sure. Many, many beginning programmers make
this mistake when asked to solve this problem. Perhaps some insight
about the nature of bugs can be gained from this example. By the time a
student writes a program of this kind, he or she should have a fair idea
of how `for` loops and `if` statements work. Likewise, the student will
have a fair understanding of the notion of primality. Yet in the
process of combining the ideas together, it's easy to get sloppy and
write incorrect code that gives some semblance of being correct.

====

.Equivalence testing errors
====

Equivalence is tricky in Java. Very inexperienced programmers confuse
the `=` operator with the `==` operator, but using the `==` operator to
test for equivalence between two references causes more (and subtler)
problems. Comparing two references with the `==` operator will evaluate
to `true` if and only if the two references point at the exact same
object.

[source,java]
----
String string1 = new String("Test");
String string2 = new String("Test");
if(string1 == string2)
    System.out.println("Identical");
else
    System.out.println("Different");
----

Because these two `String` references point to two different `String`
objects, which happen to have identical contents, the `==` returns
`false`, and the output is `Different`. With `String` objects this matter
is further confused by a Java optimization called `String` pooling.

[source,java]
----
String string1 = "Test";
String string2 = "Test";
if(string1 == string2)
    System.out.println("Identical");
else
    System.out.println("Different");
----

Because Java keeps a pool of existing `String` values, only one copy of
`"Test"` is in the pool, and both `string1` and `string2` point to it.
Thus, this second fragment of code prints `Identical`. Because of
`String` pooling, programmers can write code which can work in some
situations and fail in others, if it depends on the `==` operator.

For `String` objects as well as every other reference type, it's
almost always the case that the `equals()` method should be used to test
for comparison instead of the `==` operator. There are a few instances
when it's necessary to know if two references really and truly do refer
to the same location in memory, but these instances are a tiny
minority.

That said, the `equals()` method is not bullet-proof. With `String`
objects and most of the rest of the Java API, you can expect good
behavior from the `equals()` method. However, if you create your own
class, you're expected to implement the `equals()` method. By default,
the `equals()` method inherited from `Object` only does an equality test
using `==`.

Properly implementing the `equals()` method takes care and thought. If
your class contains references to other custom classes, you must be
certain that they also properly implement their own `equals()` methods.
Likewise, to conform to Java standards, a custom `equals()` method
implies that you have also implemented a custom `hashCode()` method so
that objects that are equivalent with `equals()` give the same hash
value. It seems nit-picky to mention this issue, but many real-world
applications depend on the efficient and correct operation of hash
tables.  Hash tables are data structures used to store and
retrieve a key and an associated value.  We'll discuss them briefly
in <<mapsExample>>.

====

==== Array errors

Any time you have a large collection of data, there are always
opportunities for bugs. With catastrophic array bugs, Java usually gives
clear exceptions that point you to the line number. Once the exception is
thrown, the bug should be obvious. The biggest difficulties arise when some
unusual course of events is responsible for the bug cropping up and you have
to reconstruct what it is.

.Out of bounds
====

We have all experienced an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Either a
little carelessness with our indexes or a mistake about the size of the
array can lead us to try to access an index that isn't in the array.
In the C language, a negative index is sometimes a legal location, but it
never is in Java. Although errors involving negative indexes sometimes occur
in code, a more common error is accessing an index slightly larger than the
bounds of an array, particularly with a loop.

[source,java]
----
int[] array = new int[100];
for(int i = 0; i <= 100; i++)
	array[i] = i;
----

In this example, the last iteration of the loop will access index `100`
when `array` only goes up to index `99`.

The causes for going out of bounds can be more subtle. We can imagine an
array of linked lists, perhaps for storing English words in a dictionary. If we
want to select a list based on the first letter of the word, we could use
an array of length 26. Consider the following helper method used to add a
new `String` to the correct list.

[source,java]
----
public void add(String word) {
	int index = word.toLowerCase().charAt(0) - 'a';
	lists[index].add(word);
}
----

We can assume that the `add()` method for a given linked list works
properly, but we might have caused other problems already. For one thing,
we assumed that `word` began with either an upper- or lowercase letter,
corresponding to our array locations 0 through 25. We're depending on
other code to check the input and throw out `String` values
like `"$1"` or `"-isms"`, which would map to indexes outside of the 0 to 25
range. Incidentally, we're also assuming that `word` has at least one character
in it. Even if we expect the input to the method to be error free, the addition
of error checking is rarely a bad idea.

====

.Uninitialized object arrays
====

Another simple mistake that can occur with arrays is failing to
initialize an object array. With a primitive data type like `int`,
creating an array with 1,000 elements automatically allocates enough
space to hold those elements and even initializes each one to a default
value, `0` in the case of an `int`. With an object data type, however,
each element of the array is a reference to `null` until it's
initialized.

[source,java]
----
Hippopotamus[] hippos = new Hippopotamus[15];
hippos[3].feed();
----

This example causes a `NullPointerException`. New programmers are often
confused by this error because they expect the exception to mention the array
or its indexes. For more experienced programmers, this kind of mistake is
more of a forehead-slapping oversight than a mind-numbing puzzler that'll take
hours to debug. It's probably just a matter of instantiating each element in
the array before you try to feed those hungry, hungry hippos.

[source,java]
----
Hippopotamus[] hippos = new Hippopotamus[15];
for(int i = 0; i < hippos.length; i++)
    hippos[i] = new Hippopotamus();
hippos[3].feed();
----
====


==== Scope errors

We don't have variables in real life, and as a consequence, our
intuition about them is sometimes wrong. Which variable you're
accessing at any given time can appear obvious, even if it really isn't.

.Shadowing variables
====

Java allows variables in different scopes to be declared with the same
identifier. If the scopes are two separate methods, then they'll never
interfere with each other. However, if one scope encloses another, the
inner variable will _shadow_ or hide the outer variable.

[source, java]
[[ShadowProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Shadow.java[]
----

In this example, the field `darkness` is being shadowed by the local
variable `darkness` in the `deepen()` method. It appears that the
programmer wanted to increase the field `darkness` by the amount passed
into the parameter `darkness` and failed to notice that both variables
have the same name. As a consequence, the parameter `darkness` will
double itself and then never be used again while the field `darkness`
will never increase. This kind of bug could go uncaught for a long while
until a programmer notices that the `Shadow` object isn't increasing in
darkness no matter how many times it's told to.

This mistake is also common in constructors, since it's
reasonable to give a certain parameter a name similar to the field it's
about to initialize. Some programmers explicitly prefix all fields with
`this` even though it's often redundant. Three additions of `this` will
fix the problem in the preceding example.

[source,java]
----
	public void deepen(int darkness) {
		this.darkness += darkness;
		if(this.darkness > 100)
			this.darkness = 100;
	}
----

In Java, scope is also defined in terms of classes and their parent
classes. A parent class variable can be shadowed by a child class
variable of the same name.

[source, java]
[[BodybuilderProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Bodybuilder.java[]
----


[source, java]
[[BraggingBodybuilderProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/BraggingBodybuilder.java[]
----


This example looks like a simple case of inheritance, but whoever wrote
the `BraggingBodybuilder` class mistakenly included the
field `strength` again. As a consequence, any `BraggingBodybuilder` will
always brag that his or her strength is 10, even when code sets his or
her strength to other values. When strength is tested, it'll use the
`strength` field from the superclass `Bodybuilder` which is set by the
`setStrength()` method. When classes have large numbers of fields,
making such a mistake becomes easier.

Dynamic and static binding complicate this scope problem further. The
fragment of code below using the class definitions from above highlights these
complications.

[source,java]
----
Bodybuilder builder = new BraggingBodybuilder();
builder.strength = 15; // <.>
BraggingBodybuilder bragger = (BraggingBodybuilder)builder;
bragger.brag();
bragger.strength = 20; // <.>
bragger.brag();
----
<.> Because fields are statically bound to the class of the
object, the `strength` field for `Bodybuilder` will be set to 15.
<.> However, the `strength` field for `BraggingBodybuilder`
will be set to 20 here.

Thus, the first call to `brag()` will print out `My strength is 10!`, but the
second call will print out `My strength is 20!`. Note that some of the
confusion in this example is possible only because the field `strength` is
`public`. If the field was `private` and only changed through methods, at
least there would no longer be two ways to set the `strength` field with
two different outcomes. 
====

.Reference vs. value
====

The final category of scope error we'll talk about occurs when using
methods because of confusion between passing by reference and passing by
value. Every variable in Java is passed by value. However, when that value
is itself a reference, it's possible to change the values that it references.

[source,java]
----
public void increaseMagnitude(int number) {
    number *= 10;
}
----

A novice Java programmer might write a method like the above, expecting
the value of `number` to increase by 10 in the calling code. Some
languages like Perl use call by reference as default. Other languages
like {cpp} and C# allow the user to mark certain parameters as call by
reference. Programmers comfortable with such languages might be confused
about the workings of Java.

On the other hand, becoming used to the pass-by-value style of Java
can cause other errors.

[source,java]
----
public void increaseMagnitude(int[] numbers) {
    numbers[0] *= 10;
}
----

In this contrasting example, the 0 index element of `numbers` *is* increased
by a factor of 10. Unlike the previous code, the increase in the value
of that element *will* affect the array passed in by the calling code. The
values in the array are shared by the `increaseMagnitude()` method and
the calling code. As you can see, the variable `numbers` isn't changing.
Reassigning the array reference to a difference array reference would have
no affect, but we're changing an element in the array, not the array
reference. The same phenomenon can occur with the fields of objects whose
references are passed into a method.

====

==== Null pointer errors

Null pointer errors usually raise a `NullPointerException` in Java. This
category of errors is something of a catch-all that could happen for
many different reasons, some of which have already been mentioned.
A `NullPointerException` could be raised because the elements of an object
array haven't been initialized. Scope problems could cause a reference to
be `null` if the programmer was mistakenly updating another reference,
leaving the reference in question uninitialized.

Though they are common, it's difficult to give a blanket explanation for
why most null pointer errors happen. Usually there's some fundamental
error in program logic. Linked lists and tree structures that rely on
`null` references to mark the end of a list or an empty child node are
especially susceptible to these errors.

One significant source of errors is careless usage of method parameters.
A programmer might pass in objects that don't conform to expectations
or even `null` references instead of objects. Well written
methods, particularly library calls, should be designed to throw an
appropriate exception when this happens. Poorly designed code might
blindly use a `null` reference without checking it first, causing a
`NullPointerException`.

=== Concurrency: Parallel bugs

We'll discuss parallel bugs briefly here because we've already
spoken in depth about the dangers of parallel programming in
<<ch14-synchronization#ch14-synchronization>>. Beyond deadlocks and
livelocks, a key difficulty with parallel bugs is that they can make the
appearance of sequential bugs nondeterministic and unpredictable.

==== Race conditions

A race condition describes the situation when the output of a program is
dependent on the timing of the execution of two or more threads. Because
of the complexity of the JVM and the OS and the fact that many other
processes might be running and interacting, it's usually impossible to
determine how two threads will be scheduled. As a consequence, if the
output of the program depends on unpredictable timing, the output will
also be unpredictable.

In Java, the way that race conditions often impact the program is
through some variable shared between multiple threads. When the schedule
of threads becomes unpredictable, the changes made to this variable can
come out of sequence, and its value becomes unpredictable. Incorrect
output means that your program has a bug, but the most frustrating
aspect of race conditions is that they're nondeterministic. Your
program could sometimes have the right answer and sometimes not. Your
program could always have the wrong answer but not always the same one.
The truly insidious issue with race conditions is that they'll usually
cause errors only a tiny percentage of the time. Thus, rigorous testing
such as we'll discuss in the second half of this chapter is necessary
to show that a race condition is occurring.

==== Deadlocks and livelocks

Both deadlocks and livelocks describe situations in which some part of
your program will stop making progress because of thread interaction. In
the case of deadlock, there will be a circular wait in which thread A
is waiting for thread B which is waiting, directly or indirectly, on
thread A. In the case of livelock, some repetitive pattern of waiting
for a condition that will never be satisfied is still going on, but the
threads continue to use CPU time and aren't simply waiting.

If your program reaches a deadlock state, it won't terminate. If
threads updating a GUI become deadlocked, your window might freeze.
Typically, deadlocks are nondeterministic and occur only some of the
time. Like all race conditions, they can be difficult to detect and
duplicate. In fact, `Thread.stop()`, `Thread.suspend()`, and
`Thread.resume()`, three seemingly useful and fundamental methods that
were originally part of the Java `Thread` class, have been deprecated
because they are deadlock prone.

==== Sequential execution

One bug that isn't even a bug in non-parallel code is
sequential execution. This situation arises when, usually due to overuse
of synchronization tools, parallel code runs sequentially. Each segment
of code, instead of running in parallel, is forced to wait for another
to complete. A certain amount of serial execution is necessary to
maintain program correctness and avoid race conditions, but Amdahl's Law
gives a rigid, mathematical characterization of how easily speedup can
be lost if serial execution makes up large portions of program execution.
Because setting up threads and using other concurrency tools has
some overheard, a parallel program executing sequentially often runs
more slowly than a completely sequential version.

Since programs are usually parallelized for the sake of speedup, it's
useful to time sections of programs to see how well you've
parallelized them. Sequential execution due to synchronization tools is
only one of the many problems that can cause slow execution. The threads
might be competing for a limited resource such as an I/O device or might be
fighting over a small section of memory, causing cache misses. Tuning
applications for maximum performance requires an expert understanding of
the concurrency issues within software as well as the underlying OS and
hardware characteristics. For now, it's enough to be aware of the risk
of sequential execution and to be as careful as possible when applying
locks and other synchronization tools.

=== Finding and avoiding bugs

What would you do if you wanted to design software for a system that
administers a dose of radiation to a specific location on a patient to help
treat them for cancer? Depending on the specification of the problem, you might
need to control various voltage sources, read data from sensors,
and create a command-line interface or a GUI. With a well-designed
specification, you could probably apply your knowledge of loops and
control structures to an API and develop a software solution that met
requirements, provided that an appropriate hardware platform existed.

But how would you know that it worked? Sure, you could run a series of
tests, but how many tests would it take for you to be convinced that it
worked perfectly? What if your grade was dependent on it working without
a single error? Or your job? Or your life?

You've probably already faced the stress of trying to get a program to
work as well as possible for the sake of your grade. It's not such a
far cry to imagine your job being on the line if you make a serious mistake
as a professional programmer. But what about your life? Perhaps you'll
never put your own life into the hands of code you write, but odds are that
you've already put your life into the hands of someone else's code.
Software controls airplanes, automobiles, medical equipment, and
countless other applications where a bug in the code could result in loss
of human life.

Sadly, there have already been cases when such bugs have surfaced with deadly
consequences. One of the most famous examples of the dangers of badly
written software is the Therac-25. The Therac-25 was a machine designed
to deliver therapeutic radiation for medical purposes. Between 1985 and
1987, use of the Therac-25 caused at least six incidents of massive
radiation overdoses, leading to at least three deaths.

Like most failures of this magnitude, there was more than a single cause
behind the Therac-25 tragedies. For one thing, the machines did give an
error code. However, the user manual did not explain the error code, and
the technicians were not trained to deal with the errors. Even when
patients complained about pain caused by the machines, the technicians
and even the manufacturers of the Therac-25 were confident that the
machine was operating correctly because neither of the previous models,
the Therac-6 and the Therac-20, had suffered any problems.
Overconfidence has played a significant role in many of the worst
systems failures, including the devastating Chernobyl disaster.

Ignoring the human errors, a number of software errors were also
responsible for the Therac-25 overdoses. The overdoses occurred when
technicians made incorrect keystrokes giving confusing instructions to
the Therac-25 about which mode of operation it should be in. In this
situation, the machine would operate with a high-power beam but without
the beam spreader that was necessary for its safe operation. The
designers ignored the possibility that this series of keystrokes would
happen. Also, a race condition was involved in this bug since it
depended on one task that set up the equipment and another that received
input from the technician. This race condition wasn't caught during testing
because only technicians with long practice could work fast enough to cause the
bug. Finally, a counter was incremented for use as a flag variable, but
arithmetic overflow occasionally caused this flag to have the wrong
value.

In the remaining half of this chapter, we'll discuss a number of
testing methodologies and design strategies to minimize errors in
software.

=== Concepts: Design, implementation, and testing

Unfortunately, there's no foolproof way to design software. There are
many researchers who work to design new languages and new development
tools to limit certain kinds of mistakes, but it's impossible to
design a language as powerful as Python or Java which will also prevent all
software bugs. A consequence of the halting problem, a fundamental
concept in the theory of computation, is that there's no way to design
a test that will detect all potential infinite loops (or infinite
recursion) for all programs.

With careful design, implementation, and testing, most errors can be
reduced almost to nothing. In the following subsections, we'll
discuss these three aspects of programming and how you can apply them to
writing better programs.

==== Design

We've remarked in the past that good design pays off ten-fold in
implementation, and that payoff continues to increase by factors of ten
as you move on to testing and eventually deployment.

One of the first design decisions you might have to make is choice of
language. Some languages are better designed for certain tasks than
others. For example, languages like Ada have been carefully designed to
minimize programming mistakes such as mis-matched `else` blocks. Many
functional languages like ML are designed so that memory errors such as
a `NullPointerException` are impossible. Even Java has taken clear steps
to avoid some of the errors possible, such as bus errors, in C and similar
languages that allow pointer arithmetic. However, many other factors such
as portability, compatibility, and speed will affect your language
choice.

If you're working in the software development industry, you might be given a
specification from your client or your supervisors. As you design the software
needed to meet the specification, you might use UML diagrams to map out the
classes and interactions you plan to implement in your program.

There are many questions you might ask yourself as you design your
solution. Will your solution be compatible with the system and future
changes made to the system? Is it easy to add features to your solution?
Does your solution deal gracefully with mistakes in user input or
external hardware and software failures? Is your code easy to maintain,
particularly by future programmers who were not involved in its initial
development? Are the components of the system modular? Can they be
worked on, tested, and upgraded independently? Are the components of
your system designed well enough to be reused for other applications?
Are the elements of your system secure from malicious attacks? Finally,
is it easy for the user to work with your software?

Each one of these questions is related to a separate sub-field in
software engineering. It might be impossible to address them all
completely, but different applications will have different priorities.
One method for OO software engineering uses _design patterns_. The idea
behind design patterns is that most classes share some common design
principles with a large category of other classes. By naming and recognizing
each category, you can apply the same rules to designing new classes
from a category you're already familiar with. Each category is called a
design pattern. Java uses design patterns extensively in its API.
Describing design patterns in greater depth is beyond the scope of this
book, but you might want to consult the Gang of Four's popular book
_Design Patterns_.

Another important idea in design is _design by contract_. Although this
is also a rich, complex area of software engineering, the idea can be
applied to methods in a straightforward way. For each method, you have a
formal explanation of what its input should be, what its output should
be, and what else can be changed in the process. For some languages and
some segments of code, it's possible to prove that a given method does
exactly what it's supposed to do. Nevertheless, Donald Knuth, a giant
in computer science, is famous for having said, "Beware of bugs in the
above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it."

==== Implementation

Once you have gotten your design to the implementation phase, there are a
number of other techniques you can use to minimize errors.
One interesting technique is _pair programming_, in which two
programmers sit at a single computer and work together. Ideally, the programmer
who is currently typing, often called the _driver_, is thinking about the
immediate problems posed by the next few lines of code while the other
programmer, often called the _navigator_, is thinking about the larger context
of the program and watching for errors. Two sets of eyes are always beneficial
when looking at something as detailed and confusing as a computer program.

In keeping with the theme of having more than one set of eyes looking at
a program, it's also useful to have the individuals who test the software be
independent from those who develop it. By keeping the testers separate, they're
not infected by the assumptions and biases that the developers made while
writing the software. Some communication between the two groups is necessary,
but there's value in black-box testing, which we'll explain in the next
subsection.

Another piece of general advice is to rely on standard libraries as much
as possible. Reinventing your own libraries is partly a waste of time
and partly dangerous because your own libraries haven't undergone as
much testing as the standard ones. Likewise, it makes your code less
portable. Some expert developers might need to write special libraries for
speed or memory efficiency, but they're the exception, not the rule.

There are a number of Java specific implementation guidelines. People
have written entire books about good software engineering in Java, and
so we'll only give a few obvious pointers.

Although it's tempting to do so when working under time pressure, *never*
write empty exception handlers. Doing so swallows exceptions blindly,
giving the user no information about the errors in his or her program. By
the same token, always make your exception handlers as narrow as
possible. Simply putting `catch(Exception e)` at the end of any
`try`-block has one of two possible outcomes: In one case your handler
is vague and the user is informed that a general error of some kind has
occurred. In the other your handler is more specific than it has a right
to be. You might have assumed that a file I/O error was likely to
occur and always report that failure. Instead, an
`ArrayOutOfBoundsException` could happen and be mistakenly reported as a
file I/O problem.

You should test the input to any public methods you write and throw a
pre-determined exception if the input is invalid. Never use assertions
to test input to public methods. In fact, you should never depend on
assertions to catch errors since they must be turned on in the JVM to
have effect. Assertions are great for debugging code before it's
released but have little or no value in the field.

==== Testing

Once you've designed and implemented your program (or ideally throughout the
process of implementation), you should test it to see if it
behaves as expected and required. The most common form of software
testing done by students is a form of _smoke test_. A smoke test is a
basic test of functionality. Such a test should simply run through the
major features of a program and verify that they seem to work under
ordinary circumstances. Often a student will barely finish the program
before the deadline and be unable to perform anything but the most basic
tests.

Smoke tests are useful because it's pointless to test the finer details
of a system that's clearly broken, but the software engineering
industry uses many other kinds of testing to ensure that a given piece
of software meets its specification. We'll briefly cover three broad
areas of testing: black-box testing, white-box testing, and regression
testing.

===== Black-box testing

Black-box testing assumes that the tester knows nothing about the
internal mechanisms of the software he or she is testing. The software
is viewed as a "`black box`" with inputs and outputs but otherwise unknown
internals. The tester chooses some subset of the possible inputs and tests to
see if the output matches the specification.

For simple programs with very little input, it might be possible to test
*all* possible input values, but doing so is impractical for most
programs. A short list of techniques for determining the appropriate set
of input values for black-box testing follows.

Equivalence Partitioning:::
  The idea behind equivalence partitioning is that large ranges of data
  might be functionally equivalent from the point of view of causing
  errors. If a tester can run a test for one element from a range of
  data, then the entire range can be tested quickly. To perform this
  kind of testing, the tester must partition data into ranges that
  function differently. The partition created is usually not really a
  partition in the mathematical sense as the sub-domains are overlapping.
  For this reason equivalence partitioning is also referred to as _subdomain_
  testing. +
{empty} +
  For example, a program controlling the temperature of the water in an
  aquarium might have legal input ranges between 32 °F and 212 °F. However, if
  the program warms the water when it's below 75 °F and cools it when it's
  above 90 °F, then values below 0, values from 0 to 74, values from 75
  to 90, values from 91 to 212, and values above 212 all constitute
  different partitions.
Boundary Value Analysis:::
  Once inputs have been partitioned into equivalent ranges, testers can
  focus on values which are near the boundaries of those ranges. For
  example, an input containing a person's age might be allowed to range
  between 0 and 150. The values -1, 0, 1, 149, 150, and 151 are good
  candidates for input from the perspective of boundary value analysis.
  As with equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis is useful
  not only for the boundaries between valid and invalid data but also
  for the boundaries between any input ranges with different program
  behavior such as the boundaries separating the five ranges of values
  for the aquarium thermostat program described above.
All-Pairs Testing:::
  Most software bugs are triggered by a single piece of input. Some
  harder to discover bugs require *two* separate pieces of input to have
  specific values at the same time before they manifest. With each
  increase in the number of different inputs that must each have
  specific values at the same time to cause a bug, the bug becomes
  increasingly difficult to detect but also increasingly unlikely to
  exist. It might be possible to test all possible values for a given
  input but impossible to test all possible values for all inputs at the
  same time. All-pairs testing is a compromise between these two
  extremes that tests all possible pairs of inputs.
Fuzz Testing:::
  The concept behind fuzz testing is to use large amounts of invalid,
  unlikely, or random data as input to a program. Although this kind of
  testing is used only to test the reliability and robustness of a
  program receiving unexpected input, it has a number of advantages. One
  significant advantage of fuzz testing is that it's quick and easy to
  design test cases. Another is that it makes no assumptions about the
  program behavior, catching errors that might never occur to a human
  being.  If fuzz testing is automated, it can also be used for
  _stress testing_, in which the program's ability to process a large amount
  of data quickly or while remaining responsive is tested.

===== White-box testing

The philosophy of white-box testing is the opposite of black-box testing.
When using white-box testing techniques, the tester has access to program
internals. The tester should employ techniques to test every possible
path that execution can take through the code. Traversing a particular
path of execution through a program is called _exercising_ that path.

In order to exercise every possible path, it's necessary to force each
conditional statement to be true on some path and false on another. Some
combinations of true and false might be impossible, but ignoring this
fact, a program with _n_ independent conditionals would
require 2^_n_^ runs to test them all. Because of the large
number of possible execution paths, white-box testing generally tries to
maximize coverage over metrics that are not quite so demanding.

Method coverage is the percentage of methods that are called by test
cases at least once. Ideally, this number is 100%. Statement coverage is
the percentage of statements that are executed by test cases. Again,
this number should be as close to 100% as possible. Branch coverage is
the percentage of conditionals that have been executed on both their
true and false branches. Getting total coverage here is difficult, but
good testing can come close.

As with black-box testing, equivalence partitioning and boundary value
methods can be used to reduce the total number of test cases. Also, it's
important to test those parts of your programs reached only in error
conditions in addition to normal operation.

===== Regression testing

Regression testing is a form of testing that's not often necessary for
student code, which is usually focused on small projects. The motivating idea
behind regression testing is that, in the act of fixing a bug or adding a
feature, existing code can be broken. Thus, even after a system has been
thoroughly tested, small changes or additions require the entire system
to be retested. As the size of a program grows, the chance of unintended
consequences increases, along with the value of performing regression
testing.

Regression testing can incorporate both black- and white-box testing.
Doing regression testing could simply mean running all the existing
tests over after every major change. At the very minimum, each time a test
uncovers a bug, that test should be added to the test suite used after each
build of the program. The use of regression testing also implies that regular
testing is being done on your code. Regular testing gives developers the
opportunity to track changes in other aspects of their program such as
memory usage, running time, responsiveness, and other non-functional issues.

=== Syntax: Java testing tools

One open-source tool for testing Java is called JUnit.
There are other testing tools for Java, and there's a wide array of
tools for testing software in virtually any language. We cover JUnit
here because it's widely accepted as a standard Java testing tool and
because it's open source.

==== JUnit testing

JUnit testing is used for unit testing Java. Unit testing is the process
of testing separate software components that will eventually work
together. By testing them individually, debugging can be done before
interactions between different components make it more difficult to find
the underlying bugs. After unit testing comes integration testing to test
how the components work together. Finally, system testing is the testing
of the complete, integrated system against its specifications.

===== Annotations

Our coverage of JUnit testing is based on JUnit 5. This version of JUnit
has simple syntax for creating JUnit tests compared to JUnit 3 and earlier,
but it also relies on _annotations_. An annotation is additional information
written into Java code that affects how the compiler or run-time system treats
the code. They are like comments, but they can affect code execution or
compilation, usually indirectly. Applying an annotation to a
method is called _decorating_. A class, a method, a variable, a package,
or even an individual method parameter can be decorated.

There are several annotations built into Java.  Here, we consider three: `@Deprecated`,
`@Override`, and `@SuppressWarnings`. If a method is decorated with
`@Deprecated`, it's deprecated and included only for backward compatibility.
The compiler will give a warning if you call deprecated code such as the following.

[source,java]
----
@Deprecated
public void oldMethod() {
    ...
}
----

Many methods in the extensive Java API are deprecated, like
`Thread.suspend()`, due to its inherent deadlock risk. As of Java 5 when
annotations were introduced, existing deprecated methods were decorated with
`@Deprecated`.  Before that, the only way to know that a method was deprecated
was by reading the documentation. The `@Override` annotation marks a method that's
overriding a parent class method, causing a compiler error if the method
isn't correctly overriding some parent class method. The `@SuppressWarnings`
annotation allows certain warning messages to be suppressed, like using
deprecated code if you really have to.

===== Basic JUnit syntax

First of all, JUnit is not a part of the standard Java API. To use it,
you should download the latest jar file from the
https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit site^] and add the path to that jar file
to your class path. Because JUnit is so universal, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and
many other IDEs provide a way to add the JUnit library to a project without
the need to download the jar file separately.

To access the JUnit facilities in your code, you need the following import.
Note that this import is different from JUnit 4 and earlier versions which
used classes from the `org.junit` package.

[source,java]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
----

Then, you need to set up a testing class just like you would any other
class. The key difference is that each method in the testing class is
designed to test some functionality of a code component. For example,
let's imagine that we want to test functionality within the Java
`Math` class such as the `ceil()`, `pow()`, and `sin()` methods.

To do so, we create a class called `MathTest` with three methods inside
of it called `ceilTest()`, `powTest()`, and `sinTest()`. Note that it's a 
common JUnit convention to end the names of the testing methods with "`Test.`"
We'll use each method to test the functionality of the three methods
that, respectively, have matching names. Although ending with "`Test`" is
a convention, there's no requirement to name these methods any particular
way. Tests in JUnit don't have to test single method calls. They could
test any functional aspect of an object or class. Nevertheless, for
documentation reasons it's wise to give the test methods names that
reflect what's being tested.

Where do annotations come in? The header for the `ceilTest()` method
should be as follows.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void ceilTest()
----

The only thing necessary to use a method for a JUnit test is to annotate
it with `@Test`. It's also necessary to make any function used for
testing `public` with a `void` return type and no parameters. Otherwise,
the JUnit framework will crash when you try to run the tests. Each
method with a `@Test` annotation is run once by JUnit, but JUnit can't
supply any arguments to them. They should be self-contained tests
without any outside input.

The exception to this rule is that you can perform some set up for the
tests and then some clean up afterward. Any method decorated with
`@BeforeEach` will be run before *every* test, and any method decorated with
`@AfterEach` will be run after *every* test. If you have some set up or
clean up that's expensive to run, you can use the annotations
`@BeforeAll` or `@AfterAll` to decorate a static method that's run
once before or after all the tests.

So far we have talked about the major aspects of writing a JUnit test
class except for the test itself. How does the JUnit test report a
success or a failure to the tester? As you would expect in Java, we use
the exception handling mechanism to indicate failures. If the test
method returns normally, the test is considered a success. If an
unhandled exception or error is thrown by the method, the test is
considered a failure. One of the most common ways of implementing this
is by using a form of assertions.

Of course, you could simply add an `assert` into the test code, then
enable assertions while running the test, but this approach means that
your tests could all incorrectly pass if you forget to enable
assertions. Instead, use the following import.

[source,java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
----

With this static import, you'll have access to many static methods
that provide useful assertion functionality. The simplest of these is
`assertTrue()`, which is essentially equivalent to an `assert` without
requiring assertions to be enabled. For example, we could code the body
of the `ceilTest()` method as follows.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void ceilTest() {
    assertTrue(4 == Math.ceil(3.1));
}
----

Another useful method is `assertEquals()` (and its close cousin
`assertArrayEquals()`) which takes two parameters and throws an
`AssertionError` if the two aren't equal. There are overloaded versions
of this method for other primitive types and `Object`. Note that the preferred
`assertEquals()` method for the `double` type takes three parameters,
including a delta threshold in case the values don't match exactly.

Using these methods, we can finally write a complete (though simple)
implementation of `MathTest.java`.

.Simple testing suite.
[source, java]
[[MathTestProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/MathTest.java[]
----

Note that the `setUp()` method is extremely trivial here, and no clean
up is needed.

====

JUnit has many other powerful features that allow you to
run suites of tests or repeated tests with specific parameterized
values, but we're only going to introduce one more feature here. In an
ideal world, you develop tests as you develop code.
In fact, a popular software development methodology is called
_test-driven development_ (TDD).  The central idea behind TDD is writing
your tests *before* you write your code.  Doing so provides clarity about
what you want your code to do, a way to know that you've written your
code correctly, a way to document your code, and a suite of tests that
grows along with your program.

Whether doing TDD or not, you might have completed a test for a specific
feature before you've finished implementing it. Or perhaps a feature
in your program is broken at the moment, but you want to continue
running tests on the rest of the features. In these cases and others, it's
useful to turn off a particular test temporarily. To do this, you add the
annotation `@Disabled` before the `@Test` annotation. In parentheses after the
`@Disabled` annotation, you should ideally put in parentheses a `String` giving
the reason why the test is being disabled.  There are even annotations that
allow you to run tests or disable them for particular platforms.

===== Running JUnit

Once you've created your JUnit test classes, you'll want to run
them. There are tools built into IDEs like Eclipse to make running easier,
but the command line is always an option. As we said before, you need to
include the JUnit jar file in your classpath. You can either do this
permanently, by adding it to a `CLASSPATH` environment variable in a way
dependent on your OS, or for a particular run of a Java tool. Assuming
that you haven't added the jar file to your classpath permanently, let's
say that you're using the JUnit Platform 1.5.1 that's included with JUnit
5.5.1 from a jar file called `junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.1.jar`
that can be found in `C:\Java\JUnit\`. If `MathTest.java` is in the current
directory, you would type the following.

....
javac -classpath .;C:\Java\JUnit\junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.1.jar MathTest.java
....

To actually run the tests, you need to tell the platform where to
look for tests to run.  Thus, you run the platform from its jar file, specifying that the class
path is the current directory (`.`), and then scan that directory for tests.  Note that it's
unnecessary to mention `MathTest` at this point since all tests in the specified class path will
be run.

....
java -jar C:\Java\JUnit\junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.1.jar --class-path . --scan-class-path
....

The output should include something like the following, showing that all three tests passed.

....
╷
├─ JUnit Jupiter ✔
│  └─ MathTest ✔
│     ├─ ceilTest() ✔
│     ├─ powTest() ✔
│     └─ sinTest() ✔
└─ JUnit Vintage ✔
....

For the command line, this output is impressive, yet the commands listed above
to run JUnit are complex.  These commands have many additional options,
allowing you to include or exclude additional paths, directories, and file
names.  While it's possible to run JUnit commands from the command
line, the process is smoother through an IDE.

=== Concurrency: Testing tools

In this section, we describe some tools that exist specifically to help catch
those bugs that crop up as a direct result of concurrency. This
section is short, and that shortness reflects the fewness of good tools
available. The design of concurrent debugging and testing tools is still an
open research topic. The heart of the problem is that the nondeterminism
present in concurrency makes bugs difficult to pin down. You could run a JUnit
test 1,000,000 times and never see a peculiar race condition. From a brute
force perspective, we could try to test all possible interleavings of thread
execution, but this approach is not practical for large programs because the
number of interleavings grows exponentially. Nevertheless, some research has
focused on attacking the problem from this direction.

==== IBM ConTest

One tool that used this idea was ConTest from IBM. Normal JVM
operation makes some interleavings more likely than others. If the
correct output is very likely and the incorrect is very unlikely, it's
easy for a tester to believe that the program works correctly. ConTest was a
tool that _instrumented_ class files after they'd been compiled by
Java. When it instrumented these files, it added extra method calls into
concurrent code designed to introduce some randomness into the system.
By introducing `sleep()` and `yield()` methods in random places, the JVM
could be forced into producing interleavings that would otherwise be
unusual. The designers of ConTest used heuristics so that ConTest
added this randomness in "`smart`" locations designed to maximize unusual
interleavings and catch bugs.

ConTest was not a panacea. Although it revealed bugs that were 
rare, it still had to be combined with strong testing methodologies so
that those bugs could be caught when they appeared. Another difficulty with
using ConTest was that it couldn't tell you where the problem happened or
when it was likely to happen under normal circumstances. You were still
dependent on your test design to reveal the source of the problem.
ConTest also didn't guarantee every possible ordering. Very rare
bugs might not have manifested even after thousands of runs with ConTest
instrumented code.  Although ConTest was one of the most promising tools
taking this approach, it is no longer available.
// This site no longer works...
// http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-contest.html[ConTest site^].

==== Devexperts tools

The open-source https://github.com/Devexperts/lin-check[Lin-check^] framework
has some similarities to ConTest.  It was designed by
https://devexperts.com[Devexperts^] specifically to test data structures such
as those we will discuss in
<<ch18-dynamic-data-structures#ch18-dynamic-data-structures>>.  Like ConTest,
Lin-check executes tests in parallel many times in an effort to find a
concurrent interleaving that causes an error condition.

The https://github.com/Devexperts/dlcheck[Dl-check^] tool was also designed by
Devexperts.  Its goal is to find deadlocks that could happen in concurrent
programs.

==== ConcJUnit and ConcurrentUnit

We hope we've convinced you of the value of using JUnit testing to
unit test your programs. Of course, JUnit has limitations, especially when
testing concurrent programs. JUnit uses exceptions to report failed
test cases, but JUnit only reports exceptions from the main
thread, not from any child threads that might be spawned. ConcJUnit allows
exceptions thrown by child threads to be reported and also forces all
child threads to join with the main thread.

In this way, it will be clear if any errors happened while a child
thread was being executed, either causing an exception to be thrown or
causing a child thread to fail to rejoin the main thread.  ConcJUnit is
intended as a drop-in replacement for JUnit, but only for JUnit 3 and 4.
ConcJUnit is no longer under active development and is unlikely to have
a version compatible with JUnit 5. ConcJUnit is part of a larger suite of
open-source tools called *Concutest* maintained at the 
http://www.concutest.org[Concutest site^].

https://github.com/jhalterman/concurrentunit[ConcurrentUnit^] is another
testing framework with annotations similar to those found in JUnit.  Although
it's not intended as a replacement for JUnit, it has facilities like ConcJUnit
that allow testers to discover when an exception occurs on child threads.


==== SpotBugs

https://spotbugs.github.io[SpotBugs^] (previously called FindBugs), is a static
analysis tool that examines programs for a long list of errors.  SpotBugs looks
for patterns that match known errors.  Most of the errors that SpotBugs looks
for have nothing to do with concurrency, but a whole section of its bug list is
devoted to multithreaded correctness.  SpotBugs can help you find incorrect
usage of synchronization tools as well as unsafe concurrent library usage.


==== Intel^®^ tools

There are industry tools for debugging and optimizing threaded programs outside
of Java. Intel^®^ produces software such as the Intel^®^ Inspector to find
concurrent errors as well as the Intel^®^ Vtune™ Amplifier to help tune threaded
programs. These products from Intel^®^, like many concurrency tools, are focused
on C/{cpp} and Fortran platforms. Historically, concurrency has been centered
in the high performance and scientific computing markets. Java, in contrast,
has been perceived as a slow language, better suited to desktop applications.
As the role of concurrency continues to evolve, so will the tools to help
programmers.

=== Examples: Testing a class

The larger the system, the more critical testing becomes. We don't have
the space to explain a complex testing example, but we can provide another
example of JUnit testing.

.A broken class
====

Using an example from physics, we can create a `PointCharge` class that has
a certain charge and a specific location in 3D space. We're also going to
introduce some errors into the class. Because the class is so simple, the
errors should be obvious. Nevertheless, we've picked reasonable errors that
might come up in real development.

.Physics class with errors.
[source, java]
[[PointChargeProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/PointCharge.java[]
----
<.> The `PointCharge` class has a straightforward constructor followed by an
accessor.
<.> Then, it has a method to determine distance to another `PointCharge`.
<.> This method in turn relies on a private helper method that can compute
distance from an arbitrary _x_, _y_, and _z_ location.
<.> Some of the harder work done by the class can be found in a method to
determine the scalar force between two charges.
<.> Another method finds the magnitude of the electric field due to the charge
at some location.

Recall from physics that the force _F_ between two charges _q_~1~ and _q_~2~
is given by the following equation.

//[stem]
//++++
//F = k_\mathrm{e} \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
//++++

[.text-center]
image::force.svg[scaledwidth=15%,pdfwidth=15%,width=15%]

In this equation, _k_~e~ is the proportionality constant
8.9875517873681764 × 10^9^ N⋅m^2^⋅C^-2^
and _r_ is the distance between the charges. Likewise, the
electric field _E_ at a given location due to a charge
_q_ is given below.

//[stem]
//++++
//E = k_\mathrm{e} \frac{q}{r^2}
//++++

====

.Testing the distance methods
====

Let's come up with a test for the `distance()` methods first. We're
going to need some other `PointCharge` objects. Let's make four altogether:
one at the origin and three one meter along each positive axis. We can create
these charges in a set up method. While we're at it, we'll give them a
variety of positive and negative charges.

[source,java]
----
@BeforeEach
public void setUp() {
	charge1 = new PointCharge(1, 0, 0, 0);
	charge2 = new PointCharge(2, 1, 0, 0);
	charge3 = new PointCharge(-1, 0, 1, 0);
	charge4 = new PointCharge(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
----

To test the `distance()` method thoroughly, we'll check the distance
from `charge1` to all the other charges as well as `charge2` to
`charge3`.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void distance() {
    assertEquals(1.0, charge1.distance(charge2), 0.000001);
    assertEquals(1.0, charge1.distance(charge3), 0.000001);
    assertEquals(1.0, charge1.distance(charge4), 0.000001);
    assertEquals(Math.sqrt(2.0), charge2.distance(charge3), 0.000001);
}
----

The distances between `charge1` and the other three should be 1, and the
distance between `charge2` and `charge3` should be around the square root of two.
Yet when we run this test with JUnit, the test
fails with the following error.

....
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<1.0> but was:<1.4142135623730951>
....

This error happens on the second assertion in the method. But why? If we comb through the
`distance()` methods in `PointCharge`, they all look correct. The
problem must be deeper. `PointCharge` doesn't have accessor methods for
its location, so we can't test those. Checking the constructor, we
find the culprit: `this.z = y;`, a simple cut and paste error.

With the `distance()` methods working, we can run a similar test for
`scalarForce()` generated by plugging in appropriate values into the
equation for _F_.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void scalarForce() {
	assertEquals(2*PointCharge.K, charge1.scalarForce(charge2), 0.000001);
	assertEquals(-PointCharge.K, charge1.scalarForce(charge3), 0.000001);
	assertEquals(0.0, charge1.scalarForce(charge4), 0.000001);
	assertEquals(-PointCharge.K, charge2.scalarForce(charge3), 0.000001);
}
----

When we run this test with JUnit, the last assertion fails. We get the
following output.

....
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<-8.987551787368176E9> but was:<-1.797510357473635E10>
....

A close inspection reveals that the actual value is about twice the
expected value. Where does this extra factor of 2 come from? Scanning
the code for `scalarForce()`, we find `return K*charge*p.charge/r*r;`

We forgot parentheses and messed up our equation. What we really wanted
was `return K*charge*p.charge/(r*r);`

The most striking thing about this example is that three test cases
passed! Perhaps that means that we were choosing values that were too
simple, but it also illustrates the importance of thorough testing.

====

.Testing the field magnitude method
====

Finally, let's test the value of the `fieldMagnitude()` method. For
simplicity, we'll test the field at the locations of `charge1`,
`charge3`, and `charge4` with respect to `charge2`.

This time the first assertion fails. We get the following output.

....
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<1.797510357473635E10> but was:<2.0>
....

`2.0` seems like a very strange result when we were expecting a value
with an order of magnitude 10 times larger. Perhaps a constant was
omitted? Yes, our version of `fieldMagnitude()` left off a factor of
`K`. Once we fix that, our code finally passes all three tests. Why didn't
we fail the assertions after the first one? Because of the exception handling
mechanism, each JUnit test method stops once a failure has happened.

`FixedPointCharge`.

. [[assertExercise]] What's the purpose of the `assert` keyword in Java? What steps must
be taken for it to be active?
. What's the value of `j` after the following statements are
executed?
+
[source,java]
----
int j = 1;
int i;
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++);
	j += i;

Assuming the programmer made an error, what category of programming
error does it fall under?
. The following loop is intended to print out all possible `byte`
values. What's the conceptual error made in the following loop? How
many times will it execute?
+
[source,java]
----
for(byte value = 0; value < 256; ++value)
	System.out.println("Byte: " + value);
----
. What are all the possible run-time errors that could occur in this
method that reverses a section of an array?
+
[source,java]
----
public void reverse(Object[] array, int start, int end) {
    Object temp;
    end--;  // Up to but not including end
    while(start < end) {
        temp = array[start];
        array[start] = array[end];
        array[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
----
+
What checks could be added to catch these errors?
. Recall the idea of a stack mentioned in <<Problem: Nested expressions>>.
Consider the following definition of a stack designed to hold `int` values.
+
[source,java]
----
public class IntegerStack {
    private static Node {
        public int data;
        public Node next;
    }

    private Node head = null;

    public void push(int value) {
        Node temp = new Node();
        temp.data = value;
        temp.next = head;
        head = temp;
    }

    public void pop() { head = head.next; }
    public int top() { return head.data; }
    public boolean isEmpty() { return head == null; }
}

What exceptions could be thrown when using this class? Where could they
be thrown?
. Imagine that you have a simple linked list such as the ones described
in <<Linked lists>>. What if
there's a loop in the list such that the last element in the list points to an
earlier element in the list? For this reason, a simple traversal of the list
will go on forever. How could you detect such a problem during program
execution? Note that this question sometimes comes up in job interviews. 
. [[blackBoxTestingExercise]] What's the difference between black-box testing
and white-box testing? What kinds of bugs are more likely to be caught by
black-box testing? By white-box testing?
. [[zuneExercise]] The Microsoft Zune was a portable media player in competition with
the Apple iPod. The first generation Zune 30 received negative publicity
because many of them froze on December 31, 2008 due to a leap year bug.
It's possible to find segments of the source code that caused this
problem on the Internet. Essentially, the clock code for the Zune
behaved correctly on any day of the year numbered 365 or lower.
Likewise, when the day was greater than 366, it would correctly move to
the next year and reset the day counter. When day was exactly 366,
however, the Zune became stuck in an infinite loop. What kind of testing
should Microsoft have done to prevent this bug?

*Programming Practice*

.  Apply JUnit testing to the last major assignment you did in class.
What bugs did you uncover?

*Experiments*

. James Gosling's original specification for Java contained
assertions, but they weren't included until Java 1.4. One of the
concerns about an assertion mechanism is the additional time required to
process the assertions. Time a program of at least moderate length
before adding `assert` statements to its methods. If you use `assert`
statements to check method input and output thoroughly, you should see a
slight decrease in performance when assertions are enabled. When
disabled, you should see almost none. How great is the performance hit?
. Take another look at your last programming assignment. Calculate the
number of branches based on `if` and `switch` statements and compute 2
raised to that power. Time your program executing once under normal
circumstances. Multiply that time by the number of different
possibilities you would need to exercise every possible combination of
branches in your program. How much total time would it take to run all of those
different executions of your program?
. Take a concurrent program you've written that relies on explicit
synchronization mechanisms for correctness. Remove all synchronization
tools and run the code many times, testing for race conditions. How many runs
does it take before a race condition causes an error?  If you can, run your
program on systems with different numbers of cores.  Using a larger number of
cores should make race conditions more evident since more processors can
execute contentious code in parallel.
