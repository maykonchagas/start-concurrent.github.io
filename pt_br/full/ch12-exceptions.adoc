=== Problem: Bank burglary

Let's consider a problem in which various aspects of a bank burglary are
modeled as Java objects. You want to write some code that will
accomplish the following steps:

. Disable the burglar alarm
. Break into the bank
. Find the vault
. Open the vault
. Carry away the loot

But any number of things could go wrong! When trying to disable the
burglar alarm, you might set it off. When you try to break into the
bank, you might have thought that you'd disabled the burglar alarm but
actually failed to do so. The door of the bank might be too difficult to
open. The vault might be impossible to find, or the vault might be
impossible to open. It could even be empty! The money might be made of
enormous gold blocks that are too heavy to carry away. Finally, at any
time during the heist, a night watchman might catch you in the act.

If you're the criminal mastermind who planned this deed, you need to
know if (and preferably how) your henchman bungled the burglary. You
need a simple system that can inform you of any errors that have
occurred along the way. Likewise, you need to be able to react
differently depending on what went wrong.

We are going to model each of these error conditions with Java
_exceptions_. An exception is how Java indicates exceptional or
incorrect situations inside of a program. These exceptions are _thrown_
when the error happens. You must then write code to _catch_ the error
and deal with it appropriately. The bank burglar program will deal with
three different classes, `Bank`, `Vault`, and `Loot`.

The `Bank` class has three methods, `disableAlarm()`, `breakIn()`, and
`findVault()`, which returns a `Vault` object. The `Vault` class has an
`open()` method and a `getLoot()` method, which returns a `Loot` object.
The `Loot` class has a `carryAway()` method. Below is a table of the
exceptions which can be thrown by each of the methods.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="3*<.^l",]
|=================================================
|Class |Method |Exceptions
.6+|Bank .2+|disableAlarm() |BurglarAlarmException
							|WatchmanException
		.3+|breakIn()		|BurglarAlarmException
							|LockPickFailException
							|WatchmanException
			|findVault() 	|WatchmanException
.3+|Vault .2+|open() 		|LockPickFailException
							|WatchmanException
			|getLoot() 		|WatchmanException
.2+|Loot .2+|carryAway() 	|LootTooHeavyException
							|WatchmanException
|=================================================

In order to deal with each of these possible errors, you need some
special Java syntax.

=== Concepts: Error handling

As a rule, computer programs are filled with errors. Writing a program
is a difficult and complex process. Even if a segment of code is free
from errors, it may call other code which contains mistakes. The user
could be making mistakes and issuing commands to a program that are
impossible to execute. Even hardware can produce errors, as in a hard
drive crash or a network connectivity problem.

==== Error codes

A robust program should deal with as many errors as possible. One
strategy is to have every method give back a special error code
corresponding to an error when it occurs. Then, the code
calling the method can react appropriately. Of course, many methods do
not return a numerical type, limiting this kind of error handling. A
solution that was very common in the C language, particularly in Unix
system calls, was to set a globally visible `int` variable called
`errno` to a value corresponding to the error that has just happened.

These approaches have a number of drawbacks. In the case of `errno`, if a
number of different threads were running at the same time, different
errors could occur simultaneously, but only one value could be kept in
`errno`. For any system that relies on checking for an error condition
after each method call, a large amount of error handling code must be
mixed in with normal code. Doing so reduces code readability and makes
it difficult to handle errors in a central place. Likewise, a numerical value
doesn't describe the error, requiring good documentation to know what
the number means.

==== Exceptions

Java adopts a different error handling strategy called exceptions.
Whenever a specified error state or unusual situation is reached, an
exception is thrown. When an exception is thrown, normal execution stops
immediately. The JVM starts backtracking, looking for code that's designed to deal with
that specific exception. The code that will handle the exception can be
in the current method, in the calling method, in the caller of the
calling method, or arbitrarily far back in the chain of method calls,
all the way to `main()`. Each method will return, looking for code to
handle this exception, until it's found. If no handling code is found,
the exception will propagate all the way past `main()`, and
the program will end.

Exceptions give a unified and simple way to handle all errors. You can
choose to deal with errors directly or delegate that responsibility to
methods that call the code you've written. Selection statements and
loops are forms of _local_ control flow, but exceptions give us the power
of _non-local_ control flow, able to jump back through any number of
method calls.

=== Syntax: Exceptions in Java

In Java syntax, there are two important sides of using exceptions:
throwing the exception when an error occurs and then handling that
exception properly. Below we explain both of these as well as the
catch or specify requirement, the `finally` keyword, and the process of
creating custom exceptions.

==== Throwing exceptions

By now you've probably experienced a `NullPointerException` in the
process of coding. This exception happens when an object reference is
`null` but we try to access one of its methods or fields.

[source,java]
----
String text = null;
int x = text.length(); // NullPointerException
----

In this case, the exception is thrown by the JVM itself. It is possible
to catch this exception and deal with it, but a `NullPointerException`
generally means a mistake in the program, not an error that can be
recovered from. Although many useful exceptions such as `NullPointerException`,
`ArithmeticException`, and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` are implicitly
thrown by the JVM, we're also allowed to throw them explicitly.

[source,java]
----
if(y < 14)
    throw new NullPointerException();
----

Like any other object, we use the `new` keyword to instantiate a
`NullPointerException` using its default constructor. Once created, we
use the `throw` keyword to cause the exception to go into effect. Any
exception you throw explicitly must use the `throw` keyword, but the
majority of exceptions thrown by your programs will either be mistakes
or exceptions thrown by library code you're calling. If you write a
significant amount of library or API code, you might use `throw` more
often.

==== Handling exceptions

Normal application programmers will find themselves writing code that
handles exceptions much more often than code that throws them. In order
to catch an exception, you must enclose the code you think is going
to throw an exception in a `try` block. Immediately after the `try`
block, you can list one or more `catch` blocks. The first `catch`
block that matches your exception will be executed.

[source,java]
----
try {
    String text = null;
    int x = text.length(); // NullPointerException
    System.out.println("This will never be printed.");
}
catch(NullPointerException e) {
    System.out.println("Surprise! A NullPointerException!");
}
----

In this case, trying to access the `length()` method of a `null`
reference will still throw a `NullPointerException`, but now it'll be
caught by the `catch` block below. The message
`"Surprise! A NullPointerException!"` will be printed to the screen, and
execution will continue normally after the `catch` block. Once the
exception is caught, it stops trying to propagate. Of course, whatever
the code was doing when the exception was thrown was abandoned
immediately because it might have depended on successful execution of
the code that threw the exception. Thus, the call to the
`System.out.println()` method in the `try` block will never be executed.

An exception will match the first `catch` block with the same class or
any superclass. Since `Exception` is the parent of `RuntimeException`
which is the parent of `NullPointerException`, we could write our
example with `Exception` instead.

[source,java]
----
try {
    String text = null;
    int x = text.length(); // NullPointerException
    System.out.println("This will never be printed.");
}
catch(Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Well, of course you got a NullPointerException!");
}
----

In general, you should write the most specific exception class possible
for your `catch` blocks. Otherwise, you might be catching a different
exception than you planned for, preventing that exception from propagating
up to an appropriate handler. For example, the following code will randomly
throw either a `NullPointerException` or an
`ArithmeticException` (because of a division by 0).

[source,java]
----
try {
    String text = null;
    int x;
    if(Math.random() > 0.5)
        x = text.length(); // NullPointerException
    else
        x = 5 / 0; // ArithmeticException
}
catch(Exception e) {
    System.out.println("You got some kind of exception!");
}
----

This code will catch either kind of exception, but it won't tell you
which you got. Instead, the correct approach is to have one `catch`
block for each possible kind of exception.

[source,java]
----
try {
    String text = null;
    int x;
    if(Math.random() > 0.5)
        x = text.length(); // NullPointerException
    else
        x = 5 / 0; // ArithmeticException
}
catch(NullPointerException e) {
    System.out.println("You used a null pointer!");
}
catch(ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("You divided by zero!");
}
----

The list of `catch` blocks can be arbitrarily long. You must always go
from the most specific exceptions to the most general, like `Exception`,
otherwise some exceptions could never be reached. The Java compiler
enforces this requirement. The `e` is a reference to the exception
itself, which behaves something like a parameter in a method. It's
common to use `e` as the identifier, but you're allowed to call it any
legal variable name. Usually, the kind of exception is all you need to
know, but every exception is an object and has fields and methods.
Particularly useful is the `getMessage()` method which can give
additional information about the exception.

****
<<unreachableExceptionExercise>>
****

==== Catch or specify

In contrast to the examples given above, you'll rarely write code to catch a
`NullPointerException` or an `ArithmeticException`. Both of these
exceptions are called _unchecked_ exceptions. In
<<ch06-arrays#ch06-arrays>>, we used the `Thread.sleep()` method to put
the execution of our program to sleep for a short period of time. We
were forced to enclose this method call in a `try` block with a `catch`
block for `InterruptedException`.

[source,java]
----
try{
    Thread.sleep(100);
}
catch(InterruptedException  e) {
    System.out.println("Wake up!");
}
----

An `InterruptedException` is thrown when another thread tells your
thread of execution to wake up before it finishes sleeping or waiting.
This exception is a _checked_ exception, meaning that Java insists that
you use a `try`-`catch` pair anytime there's even a chance of it being
thrown. Otherwise, your code won't compile.

Checked exceptions are those exceptions that your program must plan
for. Library and API code often throw checked exceptions. For example,
when trying to open a file with an API call, it's possible that no file
with that name exists or that the user might not have permission to
access it. A program should catch the corresponding exceptions and
recover rather than crashing. Perhaps the program should prompt the user
for a new name or explain that the required permission is not set.

****
<<checkedExceptionsExercise>> +
<<needThrowsExercise>>
****

In <<ch06-arrays#ch06-arrays>>, there were no executable statements in
the `catch` block used with the `Thread.sleep()` method. However, you
should *never* write an empty `catch` block. Doing so allows errors to fail silently.

****
<<genericExceptionExercise>>
****

We're allowed to put code that can throw a checked exception into a
`try`-`catch` block, but there's another option. Java has a catch
or specify requirement, meaning that your code is required either to
catch a checked exception or to specify that it has the potential for
causing that exception. To specify that a method can throw certain
exceptions, we use the `throws` keyword. Note that this is *not* the
same as the `throw` keyword.

****
<<throwThrowsExercise>> +
<<catchOrSpecifyExercise>>
****

[source,java]
----
public static void sleepWithoutTry(int milliseconds) throws InterruptedException {
    Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
}
----

In this case, there's no need for a `try`-`catch` block because the
method announces that it has a risk of throwing an
`InterruptedException`. Of course, any code that uses this method will
have to have a `try`-`catch` block or specify that it also throws
`InterruptedException`. A method can throw many different exceptions,
and you can simply list them out after the `throws` keyword, separated
by commas.

Almost every exception thrown in Java is a child class of `Exception`,
`RuntimeException`, or `Error`. Any descendant of `RuntimeException` or
`Error` is an unchecked exception and is exempt from the catch or
specify requirement. Any direct descendant of `Exception` is a checked
exception and must either be caught with a `try`-`catch` block or
specified with the `throws` keyword. We say *direct* descendant because
`RuntimeException` is a child of `Exception`, leading to the confusing
situation where only those descendants of `Exception` which are not also
descendants of `RuntimeException` are checked.

==== The `finally` keyword

To deal with the situation in which an important cleanup or finalizing
task must be done no matter what, the designers of Java introduced the
`finally` keyword. A `finally` block comes after all the `catch` blocks
following a `try` block. The code inside the `finally` block will be
executed *whether or not* any exception was thrown. A `finally` block is
often used with file I/O to close the file, which should be closed
whether or not something went wrong in the process of reading it, as
we'll demonstrate in <<Reading and writing text files>>.

The `finally` keyword is unusually powerful. If an exception isn't
caught and propagates up another level, the `finally` block will be
executed *before* propagating the exception. Even a `return` statement
will wait for a `finally` block to be executed before returning, leading
to the following bizarre possibility.

[source,java]
----
public static boolean neverTrue() {
    try {
        return true;
    }
    finally {
        return false;
    }
}
----

This method attempts to return `true`, but before it can finish, the
`finally` block returns `false`. Only one value can be returned, and the
`finally` block wins. You should be aware of `finally` blocks and their
unusual semantics. Use them sparingly and only for careful cleanup
operations when needed to guarantee that some event occurs.

Code in a `finally` block will execute *no matter what* unless the JVM
exits or the thread in question terminates.

==== Customized exceptions

Exceptions are most useful when dealing with problems encountered
by API code. In those cases, your code must merely catch exceptions
defined by someone else; however, it's sometimes useful to define your
own exceptions. For one thing, you might write some API code yourself. Generally,
you'll want to use the standard exceptions whenever possible, but your
code might generate some unusual or specific error condition that you
want to communicate to a programmer, using your own exception.

Defining a new exception is surprisingly simple. All you have to do is
write a class that extends `Exception`. Theoretically, you could
extend `RuntimeException` or `Error` instead, but you typically won't.
Children of `RuntimeException` are intended to indicate a bug in
the program, and children of `Error` are intended to indicate a system
error.

When creating your new exception, you don't even have to create
any methods, but it's wise to implement a default constructor and one
that takes a `String` as an additional message.

[source,java]
----
public class EndOfWorldException extends Exception {
    public EndOfWorldException() {}

    public EndOfWorldException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
----

As with all other classes, your exceptions should be named in a readable
way. This exception is apparently thrown when the world ends. It's
considered good style to end the name of any exception class with
`Exception`. An exception class is a fully fledged class. If you need to
add other fields or methods to give your exception the functionality it
needs, go ahead. However, the main value of an exception lies in
its existence as a named error, not in any tricks it can perform.

Here we'll give a few examples of exception handling, although
exceptions are more useful in large systems with heavy API use. We'll
start with an example of a simple calculator that detects division by
zero, then look at exceptions as a tool to detect array bounds problems,
and end with a custom exception used with the `Color` class.

.Calculator with division by zero
====

Here we implement a quick calculator that reads input from the user
in the form of _integer operator integer_, where _operator_ is one
of the four basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Our code
will perform the appropriate operation and output the answer, but we'll
use exception handling to avoid killing the program when a division
by zero occurs.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/QuickCalculator.java[lines=1..12]
----
<.> The program reads a line of input from the user.
<.> It tests to see if it's the sentinel value `"quit"`.
<.> If it isn't, the program parses it into two `int` values and a `char`.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/QuickCalculator.java[lines=13..28]
----
<.> Here we have a `try` block enclosing the code where the operations
occur.
<.> Inside the `switch` statement, the code blindly performs
addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, depending on the
value of `operator`.
<.> Then, it prints the answer.
<.> However, if a division by zero occurs, the execution jumps to the `catch` block
and prints an appropriate message.

This `try`-`catch` pair is situated
inside the loop so that the input will continue even if there was a
division by zero. We could achieve the same effect by using an `if`
statement to test if the divisor is zero, but our solution allows easy
extensions if there are other exceptions we want to catch.

====

.Array bounds
====

Exceptions provide a lot of power. If we want, we can use the
`ArrayOutOfBoundsException` as a crutch when we don't want to think
about the bounds of our array. Although this makes for an interesting
example, exceptions should *not* be used in Java to perform normal tasks.
This method takes in an array of `int` values and prints them all out.

[source,java]
----
public static void exceptionalArrayPrint(int[] array) {
    try {
        int i = 0;
        while(true)
            System.out.print(array[i++] + " ");
    }
    catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {}
}
----

Although the `while` loop will run without stopping, the moment that `i`
reaches `array.length`, it will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when
it tries to access that element in `array`. Since we left the `catch`
block empty, nothing will happen, the method will return, and everything
will work fine. This example is a peculiar kind of laziness, indeed,
since a `for` loop could achieve the same effect with fewer lines of
code.

Programmers can be tempted to abuse exceptions in this way when a lot of
calculations are needed to determine the correct bounds. Consider a game
of Connect Four. To see if a player has won, the computer must examine
all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal possibilities for four in a row.
If the game board is represented as a 2D array, the programmer must be
careful to make sure that checking for four in a row does not access any
index greater than the last row or column or smaller than 0.

The danger of using exceptions for these kinds of tasks has several
sources. First, the programmer may not deeply understand the problem and
may be careless about the solution. Second, there's a risk of hiding
exceptions that are generated because of real errors. Third, the
code becomes difficult to read and unintuitive. Finally, excessive use
of exceptions can negatively impact performance.

<<exceptionTimingExercise>>

.Color ranges
====

The `Color` class provided by Java allows us to represent a color as a
triple of red, green, and blue values with each value in the range
[0,255]. Using these three components, we can produce
256^3^ = 16,777,216 colors. If we were programming some
image manipulation software, we might want to be able to increase the
red, green, or blue values separately. If changing a value makes it
larger than 255, we could throw an exception. Likewise, if changing a
value makes it less than 0, we could throw a different exception. Let's
give two custom exceptions that could serve in these roles.

[source, java]
[[ColorUnderflowExceptionProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/ColorUnderflowException.java[]
----


[source, java]
[[ColorOverflowExceptionProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/ColorOverflowException.java[]
----


Now we can write six methods, each of which increases or decreases the
red, green, or blue component of a `Color` object by 5. If the value of
the component is out of range, an appropriate exception will be thrown.

[source,java]
----
public static Color increaseRed(Color color)
    throws ColorOverflowException {
    if(color.getRed() + 5 > 255)
        throw new ColorOverflowException("Red: " + (color.getRed() + 5));
    else
        return new Color(color.getRed() + 5, color.getGreen(), color.getBlue());
}

public static Color increaseGreen(Color color)
    throws ColorOverflowException {
    if(color.getGreen() + 5 > 255)
        throw new ColorOverflowException("Green: " + (color.getGreen() + 5));
    else
        return new Color(color.getRed(), color.getGreen() + 5, color.getBlue());
}

public static Color increaseBlue(Color color)
    throws ColorOverflowException {
    if(color.getBlue() + 5 > 255)
        throw new ColorOverflowException("Blue: " + (color.getBlue() + 5));
    else
        return new Color(color.getRed(), color.getGreen(), color.getBlue() + 5);
}

public static Color decreaseRed(Color color) throws ColorUnderflowException {
    if(color.getRed() - 5 < 0)
        throw new ColorUnderflowException("Red: " + (color.getRed() - 5));
    else
        return new Color(color.getRed() - 5, color.getGreen(), color.getBlue());
}

public static Color decreaseGreen(Color color)
    throws ColorUnderflowException {
    if(color.getGreen() - 5 < 0)
        throw new ColorUnderflowException("Green: " + (color.getGreen() - 5));
    else
        return new Color(color.getRed(), color.getGreen() - 5, color.getBlue());
}

public static Color decreaseBlue(Color color)
    throws ColorUnderflowException {
    if(color.getBlue() - 5 < 0)
        throw new ColorUnderflowException("Blue: " + (color.getBlue() - 5));
    else
        return new Color(color.getRed(), color.getGreen(), color.getBlue() - 5);
}
----

Finally, we can write a short method that changes a given color based on
user input and deals with exceptions appropriately.

[source,java]
----
public static Color changeColor(Color color) {
    System.out.println("Enter 'R', 'G', or 'B' to increase " +
        "the amount of red, green, or blue in your color. " +
        "Enter 'r', 'g', or 'b' to decrease the amount of " +
        "red, green, or blue in your color.");
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    try {
        switch(in.next().trim().charAt(0)) {
            case 'R': color = increaseRed(color); break;
            case 'G': color = increaseGreen(color); break;
            case 'B': color = increaseBlue(color); break;
            case 'r': color = decreaseRed(color); break;
            case 'g': color = decreaseGreen(color); break;
            case 'b': color = decreaseBlue(color); break;
        }
    }
    catch(ColorOverflowException e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
    catch(ColorUnderflowException e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
    return color;
}
----

The code that uses these methods and exceptions is compact. One `try`
block enclosing the method calls is needed so that the exceptions can be
caught. Following the `try`, there's a `catch` block for the
`ColorOverflowException` and one for the `ColorUnderflowException`. Each
will print out its exception, including the customized message inside.
If an exception occurred, the value of `color` would remain unchanged
because the execution would have jumped to a `catch` block before the
assignment could happen.

Note that when catching the `ColorOverflowException` or the `ColorUnderflowException`
in the above code, we do the same thing in either case: print the exception.
To reduce the amount of code, we could have caught `Exception`
instead of those two specific exceptions, but doing so would catch *all*
exceptions, not just the two related to color that we care about.

In Java 7 and higher, there's special syntax to deal with situations like the
one above where several specific exceptions are handled in the same way.  The
exception types are listed in a `catch` block with pipe symbols (`|`) between
them.  There's still only a single reference to the exception (often named
`e`).  Using this updated syntax, we could have written the `try`-`catch` above
as follows. 

[source,java]
----
    try {
        switch(in.next().trim().charAt(0)) {
            case 'R': color = increaseRed(color); break;
            case 'G': color = increaseGreen(color); break;
            case 'B': color = increaseBlue(color); break;
            case 'r': color = decreaseRed(color); break;
            case 'g': color = decreaseGreen(color); break;
            case 'b': color = decreaseBlue(color); break;
        }
    }
    catch(ColorOverflowException | ColorUnderflowException e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }

=== Solution: Bank burglary

Here's our solution to the bank burglary problem. Although somewhat
fanciful, the process could be expanded into a more serious simulation.
We begin by defining each of the exceptions.

[source, java]
[[BurglarAlarmExceptionProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/BurglarAlarmException.java[]
----


[source, java]
[[WatchmanExceptionProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/WatchmanException.java[]
----


[source, java]
[[LockPickFailExceptionProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/LockPickFailException.java[]
----


[source, java]
[[LootTooHeavyExceptionProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/LootTooHeavyException.java[]
----


Note that the default constructor for each exception is necessary, since
constructors taking a `String` value are provided for each class.
Although these default constructors do nothing other than call their
parent constructor, they are needed so that it is possible to create
each of these constructors *without* a customized message.

With the exceptions defined, we can assume that the `Bank` class and the
`Vault` class throw the appropriate exceptions when something goes
wrong. Thus, we can make a `Henchman` class who can try to do the heist
and react appropriately if there's a problem.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Henchman.java[lines=1..13]
----
<.> To burgle a bank, one must create a `Henchman` object then pass a `Bank`
object into its `burgle()` method.
<.> The method will try to disable the
alarm, break into the bank, find the vault, open the vault, get the loot
out of the vault, and carry it away.
<.> If all those steps happen
successfully, the method will print out a `String` version of the loot.

All of this code is inside of a `try` block. If an exception is thrown
at any point, the following `catch` blocks will deal with it.

<.> If a `BurglarAlarmException` happens, the henchman is forced to run
away.
<.> If a `WatchmanException` happens, the henchman is caught and must
be bailed out of jail.
<.> If a `LockPickFailException` the henchman is unable to carry the
loot off.
<.> Something similar happens for a `LootTooHeavyException`.
<.> The last `catch` block is a little unusual. In this case, a
`NullPointerException` has occurred. Within the `try` block, two obvious
sources of this exception are the `vault` and the `loot` variables. If
either of them were `null`, in the case of a vault that could not be
found or a vault that was empty, trying to call a method on that `null`
reference would throw a `NullPointerException`. Although this code shows
the power of exception handling, it's a little unwieldy since we don't
know which variable was `null`. Also, it'll hide any
`NullPointerException` that might happen for other reasons. A better
solution would be to check for each of these `null` cases or create more
specific exceptions thrown by `findVault()` and `getLoot()` if either
returns `null`.

=== Concurrency: Exceptions

Any thread in Java can throw an exception. That thread might be the main
thread or it might be an extra one that you spawned yourself. (Or even
one spawned behind the scenes through a library call.)

What happens when a thread throws an exception? As we've been
discussing in this chapter, the exception will either be caught or
propagate back to its caller. If the exception is caught, the `catch` block
determines what happens. If the exception propagates back and back and back and
is never caught, then what? If you've coded some of the examples in this
chapter, you might think the entire program crashes, but only the thread
throwing the exception dies.

.Multiple threads with exceptions
====

In a program with a single thread, an exception thrown by the `main()`
method will crash the program, completely halting execution. In a
multi-threaded program, execution will continue on all threads that have
not thrown exceptions. If even a single thread is executing, the program
will run to completion before the JVM shuts down.

.Spawns 10 threads. 9 out of 10 spawned threads as well as the main thread throw an exception and die. The remaining thread outputs the sum of the sines of 1 through 1,000,000.

[[CrazyThreadProgram]]

In the program given above, all of the threads except one will die
because of the `RuntimeException` that they throw. Note that we use the unchecked
`RuntimeException` so that Java does not complain about the lack of
`catch` blocks. The thread with a `value` of `7` will complete its
calculation and print it to the screen even though the main thread has
died. For more information on how to spawn threads, refer to
<<ch13-concurrency#ch13-concurrency>>.

====

This behavior can cause a program that never seems to finish. You might
write a program that spawns a number of threads and does some work. Even
if the `main()` method has completed and all the important data has been
output, the program won't terminate if any threads are still alive.
This problem can also be caused by creating a GUI (such as a `JFrame`),
which spawns one or more threads indirectly, if the GUI isn't properly
disposed.

==== `InterruptedException`

In conjunction with concurrency, one exception deserves special
attention: `InterruptedException`. This exception can happen when a thread calls
`wait()`, `join()`, or `sleep()`. It's a checked exception, requiring
either a `catch` block or a `throws` specification.

This exception is used in cases where the executing thread must wait for
some event to occur or some time to pass. In extreme circumstances,
another thread can interrupt the waiting thread, forcing it to continue
executing before it's done waiting. If that happens, the code in the
`catch` block determines how the thread should recover from being awoken
prematurely.

Programmers who are new to concurrency in Java are often confused or
annoyed by `InterruptedException`, particularly since it never seems to be thrown.
Although it's thrown rarely, situations such as a system shutting down
may be best dealt with by calling `interrupt()` on a waiting thread,
causing such an exception. Although we'll generally leave the
`InterruptedException` `catch` block empty in this book, threads written
for production code should always handle interruptions gracefully.

=== Exercises
*Conceptual Problems*

.  [[advantageOfExceptionsExercise]] What are the advantages of
using exceptions instead of returning error codes?
.  [[finalFinallyFinalizeExercise]] The keywords `final` and `finally`,
as well as the `Object` method `finalize()`, are sometimes confused.
What's the purpose of each one?
.  [[throwThrowsExercise]] What's the difference between the
`throw` keyword and the `throws` keyword?
.  [[catchOrSpecifyExercise]] Explain the catch or specify
requirement of Java.
.  [[checkedExceptionsExercise]] What must be done differently
when using methods that throw checked exceptions as compared to
unchecked exceptions? How do the classes `Exception`,
`RuntimeException`, and `Error` play a role?
.  [[genericExceptionExercise]] For every program you write, you
could choose to put the entire body of your `main()` method in a large
`try` block with a `catch` block at the end that catches `Exception`. In
this way, no exception would cause your program to crash. Why is this
approach a bad programming decision?
.  Why did the designers of Java choose to make `NullPointerException`
and `ArithmeticException` unchecked exceptions even though a program that
unintentionally dereferences a `null` pointer or
divides by zero will often crash?
.  [[needThrowsExercise]] Consider the following two classes.
+
[source,java]
----
public class Trouble {
    public makeTrouble() {
        throw new ArithmeticException();
    }
}

public class Hazard {
    public makeHazard() {
        throw new InterruptedException();
    }
}
----
+
Class `Trouble` will compile, but class `Hazard` will not. Explain why
and what could be done to make `Hazard` compile.
.  [[finallyReturnExercise]] What value will the following method
always return and why?
+
[source,java]
----
public static int magic(String value) {
    try {
        int x = Integer.parseInt(value);
        return x;
    }
    catch(Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Some exception occurred.");
        return 0;
    }
    finally {
        return -1;
    }
}
----
. [[unreachableExceptionExercise]] Why will the following
segment of code fail to compile?
+
[source,java]
----
try{
    Thread.sleep(1000);
}
catch(Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Exception occurred!");
}
catch(InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println("Woke up early!");
}
----
. [[competingExceptionsExercise]] Consider the following fragment of
Java.
+
[source,java]
----
try {
    throw new NullPointerException();
}
finally {
    throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException();
}
----
+
This code is legal Java. It's possible to have a `finally` block after
a `try` block without any `catch` blocks between them. However, only a
single exception can be active at once. Which exception will propagate
up from this code and why?

*Programming Practice*

. [[NumberFormatExceptionExercise]] The `NumberFormatException`
exception is thrown whenever the `Integer.parseInt()` method receives a poorly formatted `String` representation of an integer.
Re-implement `QuickCalculator` to catch any `NumberFormatException` and give an appropriate message to the user.
. [[customExceptionsExercise]] Refer to
<<celestialSimulatorExercise>> and add to the basic mechanics of the simulation by designing two custom
exceptions, `CollisionException` and `LightSpeedException`. These
exceptions should be thrown, respectively, if two bodies collide or if
the total magnitude of a body's velocity exceeds the speed of light.
. [[passwordExceptionExercise]] Users often log onto systems by
entering their user name and a password. Unfortunately, human beings are
notoriously bad at picking passwords. In computer security, a tool
called a _proactive password checker_ allows a user to pick a password
but rejects the choice if it doesn't meet certain criteria.
+
Common criteria for a password are that it must be at least a certain
length, must contain must contain uppercase and lowercase letters, must
contain numerical digits, must contain symbols, cannot be the same as a
list of words from a dictionary, and others.
+
Write a short program with a `check()` method that takes a single
`String` parameter giving a possible password. This method should throw
an exception if the password does not meet the matching criteria listed
below.
+
[.center%autowidth%header,cols="<.^,<.^l"]
|==================================================================
|Password criteria|Exception
|At least 8 characters in length |TooShortException
|Contains both upper- and lowercase letters |NoMixedCaseException
|Contains at least one numerical digit |NoDigitException
|Contains at least one symbol |NoSymbolException
|==================================================================
+
Your `main()` method should prompt the user to select a password and
then pass it to the `check()` method. If the method throws an exception,
you should catch it and print an appropriate error message. Otherwise,
you should report to the user that the password is acceptable. Note that
you'll need to define each of the four exceptions as well.


*Experiments*

. [[exceptionTimingExercise]] Throwing and catching exceptions
is a useful tool for making robust programs in Java. However, the JVM
machinery needed to implement such a powerful tool is complex. Create an
array containing 100,000 random `int` values. First, sum all these
variables up using a `for` loop and time how long it takes. Then, do the
same thing, but, inside of the `for` loop, put a `try` block containing
a simple division by zero instruction such as `x = 5 / 0;`. After the
`try` block, put a `catch` block catching an `ArithmeticException`.
Time this version of the code. Again, you may
wish to use `System.nanoTime()` to measure the time accurately. Was
there a large difference in the time taken? Do your findings have any
implications for code that routinely throws thousands of exceptions?
