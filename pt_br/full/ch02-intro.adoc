If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.

=== Problem: How to solve problems

How do we solve problems in general? This question is the motivating
problem (or meta-problem, even) for this chapter. In fact, this question
is the motivating problem for this book. We want to understand the
process of solving problems with computers.

As we mentioned in the previous chapter, many _computer programs_ such
as business applications and web browsers have already been created to
help people solve problems, but we want to solve new problems by writing
our own programs. The art of writing these programs is called _computer
programming_ or just programming.

Many people reading this book will be computer science students, and
that's great. However, computers have found their way into every segment
of commercial enterprise and personal life. Consequently, programming
has become a general-purpose skill that can aid almost anyone in their
career, whether it's in transportation, medicine, the military,
commerce, or innumerable other areas.

==== What is a program?

If you don't have a lot of experience with computer science, writing a
computer program may seem daunting. The programs that run on your
computer are complex and varied. Where would you start if you wanted to
create something like Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop?

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that a computer
follows. Even the most complex program is just a list of instructions.
The list can get very long, and the computer can jump around
the list when it makes decisions about what to do next.

Researchers continue to make progress in the field of artificial intelligence,
but there is still an enormous gulf between artificial intelligence and human intelligence. 
Furthermore, it is the _software_ whose intelligence those researchers strive to improve.
Computer hardware is neither smart nor stupid because a computer has no intelligence
to measure. A computer is a machine like a sewing machine or an internal
combustion engine. It follows the instructions we give it blindly. It
doesn't have feelings or opinions about the instructions it receives.
Computers do exactly what we tell them to and rarely make mistakes.

Once in a while, a computer will make a mistake due to faulty
construction, a bad power source, or cosmic rays, but well over 99.999%
of the things that go wrong with computers are because some human
somewhere gave a bad instruction. This point highlights one of the most
challenging aspects of programming a computer. How do you organize your
thoughts so that you express to the computer exactly what you want it to
do? If you give a person directions to a drug store, you might say,
"`Walk east for two blocks and then go into the third door on the
right.`" The human will fill in all the necessary details: Stopping for
traffic, crossing at crosswalks, watching out for construction, and so on.
Given a robot body, a computer would do exactly what you say. The instructions never mentioned
*opening* the door, and so a computer might walk right through the
closed door, shattering glass in the process.

==== What is a programming language?

What's the right level of detail for instructions for a computer? It
depends on the computer and the application. But how do we give these
instructions? Programs are composed of instructions written in a
_programming language_. In this book, we will use the Java programming
language.

Why can't the instructions be given in English or some other natural
language? If the previous example of a robot walking through a glass
door didn't convince you, consider the quote from Groucho Marx, "`One
morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas,
I'll never know.`"

Natural languages are filled with idioms, metaphors, puns, and other
ambiguities. Good writers use these to give life to their poetry and prose,
but our goal in this book is not to write poetry or prose. We want to
write crystal clear instructions for computers.

Learning Java is not like learning Spanish or Swahili. Like most
programming languages, Java is highly structured. It has fewer than 100
reserved words and special symbols. There are no exceptions to its
grammatical rules. Don't confuse the process of designing a solution to
a problem with the process of implementing that solution in a
programming language. Learning to organize your thoughts into a
sequential list of instructions is different from learning how to
translate that list into Java or another programming language, but
there's a tight connection between the two.

Learning to program is patterning your mind to think like a machine, to
break everything down into simple logical steps. At first, Java
code will look like gobbledygook. Eventually, it'll become so familiar
that a glance will tell you volumes about how a program works. Learning
to program is not easy, but the kind of logical analysis involved is
valuable even if you never program afterward. If you do need to learn
other programming languages in the future, it will be easy once you've
mastered Java.

==== An example problem

This chapter takes a broad approach to solving problems with a computer,
but we need an example to make some of the steps concrete. We use
the following problem from physics as an example throughout this
chapter.

A rubber ball is dropped on a flat, hard surface from height
_h_. What's the maximum height the ball will reach after
the _k_^th^ bounce? We'll discuss the steps
needed to create a program to solve this problem in the next section.

=== Concepts: Developing software

==== Software development lifecycle

The engineers who built the first digital computers also wrote the
programs for them. In those days, programming was closely tied to the
hardware, and the programs were not very long. As the capabilities of
computers have increased and programming languages have evolved,
computer programs have grown more and more complicated. Hundreds of
developers, testers, and managers are needed to write a set of programs
as complex as Microsoft Windows 10.

Organizing the creation of such complicated programs is challenging, but
the industry uses a process called the _software development lifecycle_
to help. This process makes large projects possible, but we can apply it
to the simpler programs we'll write in this book as well. There are
many variations on the process, but we'll use a straightforward
version with the following five steps:

1.  *Understand the problem:* It seems obvious, but when you go to
write a program, all kinds of details need to be worked out. Consider a program that
stores medical records. Should the program give an error if a patient's
age is over 150 years? What if advances in long life or cryogenic
storage make such a thing possible? What about negative ages? An unborn
child (or more outlandishly, someone who had traveled back into the past using
a time machine) could be considered to have a negative age.
+
Even small details like these must be carefully considered to understand
a problem fully. In industry, understanding the problem is often tied to
a _requirements document_, in which a client lays out the features and
functionality that the final program should have. The "`client`" could
also be a manager or executive officer of the company you work for who
wants your development team to create a certain kind of program.
Sometimes the client does not have a strong technical background and
creates requirements that are difficult to fulfill or vaguely specified.
The creation of the requirements document can be a negotiation process
in which the software development team and their client decide together
what features are desirable and reasonable.
+
If you're taking a programming class, you can think of your instructor
as your client. Then, you can view a programming assignment as a
requirements document and your grade as your payment awarded based on
how well the requirements were fulfilled.
2.  *Design a solution:* Once you have a good grasp on the problem, you
can begin to design a solution. For large scale projects, this may
include decisions about the kinds of hardware and software packages that
will be needed to solve the problem. For this book, we'll only talk
about problems that can be solved on standard desktop or laptop
computers with Java installed.
+
We'll be interested only in the steps that the computer will have to
take to solve the problem. A finite list of steps taken to solve a
problem is called an _algorithm_. If you've ever done long division
(or any other kind of arithmetic) by hand, you've executed an
algorithm. The steps for long division will work for any real numbers,
and most human beings can follow the algorithm without difficulty.
+
An algorithm is often expressed in _pseudocode_, a high level, generic,
code-like system of notation. Pseudocode is similar to a programming
language, but it doesn't have the same detail. Algorithms are often
designed in pseudocode so that they aren't tied to any one programming
language.
+
When attacking a problem, it's typical to break it into several smaller
subproblems and then create algorithms for the subproblems. This
approach is called _top-down_ programming.
3.  *Implement the solution:* Once you have your solution planned, you
can _implement_ it in a programming language. This step entails taking
all the pseudocode, diagrams, and any other plans for your solution and
translating them into code in a programming language. We use
Java for our language in this book, but real developers use whichever
language they feel is appropriate.
+
If you've designed your solution with several parts, you can implement
each one separately and then integrate the solutions together.
Professional developers often assign different parts of the solution to
different programmers or even different teams of programmers.
+
Students are often tempted to jump into the implementation step, but
never forget that this is the third step of the process. If you don't
fully understand the problem and have a plan to attack it, the
implementation process can become bogged down and riddled with mistakes.
At first, the problems we introduce and the programs needed to solve
them will be simple. As you move into more complicated problems in this
book and in your career as a programmer, a good understanding of the
problem and a good plan for a solution will become more and more
important.
4.  *Test the solution:* Expressing your algorithm in a programming
language is difficult. If your algorithm was wrong, your program won't
always give the right answer. If your algorithm was right but you
made a mistake implementing it in code, your program will still be
wrong. Programming is a very detail-oriented activity. Even experienced
developers make mistakes all the time.
+
Good design practices help, but all code must be thoroughly tested after
it's been implemented. It should be tested exhaustively with expected
and unexpected input. Tiny mistakes in software called _bugs_ can lie
hidden for months or even years before they're discovered. Sometimes a
software bug is a source of annoyance to the user, but other times, as
in aviation, automotive, or medical software, people die because of
bugs.
+
Most of this book is dedicated to designing solutions to problems and
implementing them in Java, but <<ch16-testing-and-debugging#ch16-testing-and-debugging>>
is all about testing and debugging.
5.  *Maintenance:* Imagine you've gone through the previous four
steps: You understood all the details of a problem, planned a solution
to it, implemented that solution in a programming language, and tested
it until it was perfect. What happens next?
+
Presumably your program is shipped to your customers and they happily
use it. But what if a bug is discovered that slipped past your testing?
What if new hardware comes out that's not compatible with your program?
What if your customers demand that you change one little feature?
+
Particularly with complex programs that have a large number of
consumers, a software development company must spend time on customer
support. Responsible software developers are expected to fix bugs, close
security vulnerabilities, and polish rough features. This process is
called _maintenance_. Developers are often working on the next version
of the product, which could be considered maintenance or a new project
entirely.
+
Although we cannot stress the importance of the first four steps of the
software development lifecycle enough, maintenance is not something we
talk about in depth.

The software development lifecycle we presented above is a good guide,
but it does not go into details. Different projects require different
amounts of time and energy for each step. It's also useful to focus on
the steps because it's less expensive to fix a problem at an earlier
stage in development. It's impossible to set the exact numbers, but
some developers assume that it takes ten times as much effort to fix a
problem at the current step than it would have at the previous step.

.Rising costs of fixing an error
====

Imagine that your company works on computer-aided design (CAD) software.
The requirements document for a new program lists the formula for the
area of a triangle as _base_ â _height_ when the real
formula is Â½ _base_ â _height_. If that mistake were caught while understanding the
problem, it would mean changing one line of text. Once the solution to
the problem has been designed, there might be more references to the
incorrect formula. Once the solution has been implemented, those
references will have turned into code that is scattered throughout the
program. If the project were poorly designed, several different pieces
of code might independently calculate the area of a triangle
incorrectly. Once the implementation has been tested, a change to the
code will mean that everything has to be tested from the very beginning,
since fixing one bug can cause other bugs to surface. Finally, once the
maintenance stage has been reached, the requirements, plan,
implementation, and testing would all need to be updated to fix the bug.
Moreover, customers would already have the faulty program. Your company
would have to create a patch to fix the bug and distribute it over the
Internet.

Most bugs are more complicated and harder to fix, but even this simple
one causes greater and greater repercussions as it goes uncaught. A
factor of ten for each level implies that it takes 10,000 times more
effort to fix it in the maintenance phase than at the first phase. Since
fixing it at the first phase would have required a few keystrokes and
fixing it in the last phase would require additional development and
testing with web servers distributing patches and e-mails apologizing
for the mistake, a factor of 10,000 could be a reasonable estimate.

====

Now that we have a sense of the software development lifecycle, let's
look at an example using the sample ball bouncing problem to walk
some of its steps.

[[ballBouncingProblemExample]]
.Ball bouncing problem and plan
====
Recall the statement of the problem from the *Problem* section:

A rubber ball is dropped on a flat, hard surface from height
_h_. What is the maximum height the ball will reach after
the _k_^th^ bounce?

1.  *Understand the problem:* This problem requires an understanding of
some physics principles. When a ball is dropped, the height of its first
bounce depends on a factor known as the _coefficient of restitution_.
+
If _c_ is the coefficient of restitution, then the ball will
bounce back the first time to a height of _hc_. Then,
we can act as if the ball were being dropped from this new height when
calculating the next bounce. Thus, it will bounce to a height of
_hc_^2^ the second time. By examining this pattern for
the third and fourth bounce, it becomes clear that the ball will bounce
to a height of _hc_^_k_^ on the
_k_^th^ time. See <<bouncingBallFigure>>
for a graphic description of this process.
+
We're assuming that _k_ > 0 and that _c_ < 1.
Note that _c_ depends on many factors, such as the
elasticity of the ball and the properties of the floor on which the ball
is dropped. However, if we know that we will be given _c_,
we don't need to worry about any other details.
+

.A ball is dropped from height _h_. The ball rises to height _hc_ after the first bounce and to _hc_^2^ after the second.

2.  *Design a solution:* This problem is straightforward, but it's
always useful to practice good design. Remember that you've got to plan
your input and output as well as the computation in a program. As
practice for more complicated problems, let's break this problem down
into smaller subproblems.
+
Subproblem 1:::
  Get the values of _h_, _c_, and
  _k_ from the user.
Subproblem 2:::
  Compute the height of the ball after the _k_^th^
  bounce.
Subproblem 3:::
  Display the calculated height.
+
The solution to each of the three subproblems requires input and
generates an output. <<subProblemRelationFigure>> shows how these
solutions are connected. The first box in this figure represents the
solution to subproblem 1. It asks a user to input values of parameters
_h_, _c_, and _k_. It sends these
values to the next box, which represents a solution to subproblem 2.
This second box computes the height of the ball after _k_
bounces and makes it available to the third box, which represents a
solution to subproblem 3. This third box displays the calculated height.
+

Before we can continue on to Step 3, we need to learn some Java.
<<Syntax: Java basics>> introduces you to the Java you'll need to
solve this problem.

====

==== Acquiring a Java compiler

Before we introduce any Java syntax, you should make sure you have
a Java compiler set up so that you can follow along and test your
solution. Programming is a hands-on skill. It's impossible to improve
your programming abilities without practice. No amount of reading about
programming is a substitute for the real thing.

Where can you get a Java compiler? Fortunately, there are free options
for almost every platform. Non-Windows computers may already have the
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, allowing you to run Java
programs; however, many Java development options require you to have the
Java Development Kit (JDK). Oracle may change the website, but at the
time of writing you can download the JDK from the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads[Oracle downloads site^]. Download a current
version (e.g., Java SE 8 or 11) of the Java Platform,
Standard Edition JDK and install it.

After having done so, you should be able to compile programs using the
`javac` command, whose name is short for "`Java compiler.`" To do so,
open a terminal window, also known as a command line interface or the
console. To open the terminal in Windows, choose the Windows Powershell
option from the Start Menu. To open the
terminal in macOS, select Terminal from the Utilities folder. Different distributions of
Linux have different ways of accessing the terminal, but Linux users are usually
familiar with their terminal.

Provided that you have your path set correctly, you should be able to
open the terminal, navigate to a directory containing files that end in
`.java`, and compile them using the `javac` command. For example, to
compile a program called `Example.java` to bytecode, you would type:

----
javac Example.java
----

Compiling the program creates a `.class` file, in this case,
`Example.class`. To run the program contained in `Example.class`, you
would type:

----
java Example
----

Doing so fires up the JVM, which uses the JIT compiler to compile the
bytecode inside `Example.class` into machine code and run it. Note that
you  type only `Example` not `Example.class` when specifying the
program to run. Using just these commands from the terminal, you can
compile and run Java programs. The command line interface used to be the
only way to interact with a computer, and though it seems primitive at
first, the command line has amazing power and versatility.

To use the command line interface to compile your own Java program, you
must first create a text file with your Java code in it. The world of
programming is filled with many text editor applications whose only
purpose is to make writing code easier. These editors are not like
Microsoft Word: They are not used to format the text into paragraphs or
apply bold or italics. Their output is a "`plain`" text file,
containing only unformatted characters, similar to the files created by
Notepad. Some text editors have advanced features useful for
programmers, such as syntax highlighting (marking special words and
symbols in the language with colors or fonts),
language-appropriate auto-completion, and powerful find and replace
tools. Two of the most popular text editors for command line use are
vi-based editors, particularly Vim, and Emacs-based editors,
particularly GNU Emacs.

Many computer users, however, are used to a _graphical user interface_
(GUI), where a mouse can be used to interact with windows, buttons, text
boxes, and other elements of a modern user interface. There are
Java programming environments that provide a GUI from which a user can
write Java code, compile it, execute it, and even test and debug it.
Because these tools are integrated into a single program, these
applications are called _integrated development environments_ (IDEs).

Two of the most popular Java IDEs are Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
Eclipse is open-source, free, and available http://www.eclipse.org[here^].
Although some versions of IntelliJ IDEA cost money, the Community edition
of IntelliJ IDEA is free and available https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[here^].

Which text editor or graphical IDE you use is up to you.
Programming is a craft, and every artisan has favorite
tools. Most of the content of this book is completely independent from
the tools you use to write and compile your code. One exception is
<<ch16-testing-and-debugging#ch16-testing-and-debugging>>, in which we briefly discuss
the debugging tools in Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.

If you choose Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or another complex IDE, you may wish to
read online tutorials to get started. These IDEs often require the
user to make a project and then create Java files inside. The idea of a
project containing related source code files is a useful one
and is very common in software engineering, but it is not a part of Java
itself.

=== Syntax: Java basics

In this section, we start with the simplest Java programs and work up to
the solution to the bouncing ball problem. _Syntax_ is the rules for
constructing legal programs, just as English grammar is the rules
for constructing legal English sentences. Java was first released in
1995, a long time ago in the history of computer science, but it
was based on even older languages. Its syntax inherits ideas from C, {cpp},
and other languages.

Some critics have complained about elements of the syntax or semantics
of Java. _Semantics_ are rules for what code means. Remember that Java
is an arbitrary system, designed by fallible human beings. The rules for
building Java programs are generally logical, but they are artificial.
Learning a new programming language is a process of accepting a set of
rules and coming up with ways to use those rules to achieve your own
ends.

There are reasons behind the rules, but we won't always be able to
explain those reasons in this book. As you begin to learn Java, you'll
have to take it on faith that such-and-such a rule is necessary, even
though it seems useless or mysterious. In time, these rules will become
familiar and perhaps sensible. The mystery will fade away, and the rules
will begin to look like an organic and logical (though imperfect) system.

==== Java program structure

The first rule of Java is that all code goes inside of a _class_. A
class is a container for blocks of code called _methods_, and it can also
be used as a template to create _objects_. We'll talk a bit more about
classes in this chapter and then focus on them heavily in
<<ch09-classes#ch09-classes>>.

For now, you only need to remember that every Java program has at least
one class. It is possible to put more than one class in a file, but you
can only have one top-level _public_ class per file. A public class is
one that can be used by other classes. Almost every class in this book
is public, and they should be clearly marked as such. To create a public
class called `Example`, you would type the following:

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
}
----

A few words in Java have a special meaning and cannot be used for
other purposes (like the name you give a class). These are called _keywords_ or
_reserved words_.  The keyword `public` marks the class as public. The
keyword `class` states that you are declaring a class. All keywords are lowercase in Java. 

The name `Example` gives the name of the class. By convention, all class names
start with a capital letter. The braces (`{` and `}`) mark the start
and end of the contents of the class. Right now, our class contains
nothing.

****
<<javaKeywordsExercise>>
****

This text should be saved in a file called `Example.java`. It's
required that the name of the public class matches the file that it's
in, including capitalization. Once `Example.java` has been saved, you
can compile it into bytecode. However, since there's nothing in class
`Example`, you can't run it as a program.

A program is a list of instructions, and that list has to start
somewhere. For a normal Java application, that place is the `main()`
method. Throughout this book, we always append parentheses `()` to mark
the name of a method. If we want to do something inside of `Example`,
we'll have to add a `main()` method like so:

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
----

There are several new items now. As before, `public` means that other
classes can use the `main()` method. The `static` keyword means that the
method is associated with the class as a whole and not a particular
object. The `void` keyword means that the method does not give back a result.
The word `main` is obviously the name of the method, but it has
to be spelled exactly that way (including capitalization) to work.
Perhaps the most confusing part is the expression `String[] args`, which
is a list of text (strings) given as input to the `main()` method from
the command line. As with the class, the braces mark the start and end
of the contents of the `main()` method, which is currently empty.

Right now, you don't need to understand any of this. All you need to
know is that, to start a program, you need a `main()` method and its
syntax is always the same as the code listed above. If you save this
code, you can compile `Example.java` and then run it, and...nothing
happens! It's a perfectly legal Java program, but the list of
instructions is empty.

==== Command line input and output

An important thing for a Java program to do is to communicate with the
outside world (where humans live). First, let's look at printing data to the
command line and reading data in from the command line.

===== The `System.out.print()` method

Methods allow us to perform actions in Java. They are blocks of code
packaged up with a name so that we can run the same piece of code
repeatedly but with different inputs. We discuss them in much greater
depth in <<ch08-methods#ch08-methods>>.

A common method for output is `System.out.print()`. The input (usually
called _arguments_) to a method are given between its parentheses. Thus,
if we want to print `42` to the terminal, we type:

[source, java]
----
System.out.print(42);
----

Note that the use of the method has a semicolon (`;`) after it. An
executable line of code in Java generally ends with a semicolon to
separate it from the next instruction. We can add this code to our
`Example` class, yielding:

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(42);
    }
}
----

If we want to print out text, we give it as the argument to
`System.out.print()`, surrounded by double quotes (`"`). It's necessary
to surround text with quotes so that Java knows it's text and not the
name of a class, method, or variable. Text surrounded by double quotes
is called a _string_. The following program prints `Forty two` onto the
terminal.

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Forty two");
    }
}
----

Printing out one thing is great, but programs are usually composed of
many instructions. Consider the following program:

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(2);
        System.out.print(4);
        System.out.print(6);
        System.out.print(8);
    }
}
----

As you can see, each executable line ends with a semicolon, and they are
executed in sequence. This code prints 2, 4, 6, and 8 onto the screen.
However, we did not tell the program to move the cursor to a new line at
any point so the output on the screen is `2468`, which looks like a
single number. If we want them to be on separate lines, we can achieve
this with the `System.out.println()` method, which moves to a new line
*after* it finishes output.

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(2);
        System.out.println(4);
        System.out.println(6);
        System.out.println(8);
    }
}
----

This change makes the output into the following:

----
2
4
6
8
----

In Java, it's possible to insert math almost anywhere. Consider
the following program, which uses the `+` operator.

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(35 + 7);
    }
}
----

This code prints out `42` to the terminal just like our earlier example,
because it does the addition before giving the result to
`System.out.print()` for output.

===== The `Scanner` class

We want to be able to read input from the user as well. For command line
input, we need to create a `Scanner` object. This object is used to read
data from the keyboard. The following program asks the user for an
integer, reads in an integer from the keyboard, and then prints out the
value multiplied by 2.

[source, java]
----
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in;
        in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int value;
        value = in.nextInt();
        System.out.print("That number doubled is: ");
        System.out.println(value * 2);
    }
}
----

This program introduces several new elements. First, note that it begins
with +
`import java.util.Scanner;`. This line of code tells the compiler to use
the `Scanner` class that is in the `java.util` _package_. A package is a
way of organizing a group of related classes. Someone else wrote the
`Scanner` class and all the other classes in the `java.util` package,
but by importing the package, we're able to use their code in our
program.

Then, skip down to the first line in the `main()` method. The code
`Scanner in;` _declares_ a _variable_ called `in` with _type_ `Scanner`.
A variable can hold a value. The variable has a specific type, meaning
the kind of data that the value can be. In this case the type is
`Scanner`, meaning that the variable `in` holds a `Scanner` object.
Declaring a variable creates a box that can hold things of the specified
type. To declare a variable, first put the type you want it to have,
then put its _identifier_ or name, and then put a semicolon. We chose to
call the variable `in`, but we could have called it `input` or even
`marmalade` if we wanted. It's always good practice to name your
variable so that it's clear what it contains.

The next line _assigns_ a value to `in`. The assignment operator (`=`)
looks like an equal sign from math, but think of it as an arrow that
points left. Whatever's on the right side of the assignment operator
will be stored into the variable on the left. The variable `in` was
an initially empty box that could hold a `Scanner` object. The code
`new Scanner(System.in)` creates a brand new `Scanner` object based on
`System.in`, which means that the input will be from the keyboard. The
assignment stored this object into the variable `in`. The fact that
`System.in` was used has *nothing* to do with the fact that our variable
was named `in`. Again, don't expect to understand all the details at
first. Any time you need to read data from the keyboard, you'll need
these two lines of code, which you should be able to copy verbatim. It's
possible to both declare a variable and assign its value in one line.
Instead of the two line version, most programmers would type:

[source, java]
----
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
----

Similarly, the line `int value;` declares a variable for holding integer
types. The next line uses the object `in` to read an integer from the
user by calling the `nextInt()` method. If we wanted to read a floating-point
value, we would have called the `nextDouble()` method. If we
wanted to read some text, we would have called the `next()` method.
Unfortunately, these differences means that we have to know what type of
data the user is going to enter. If the user enters an unexpected type,
our program could have an error. As before, we could combine the
declaration and the assignment into a single line:

[source, java]
----
int value = in.nextInt();
----

The final two lines give output for our program. The former prints
``That number doubled is: `` to the terminal. The latter prints out a
value that is twice whatever the user entered. The next two examples
illustrate how `Scanner` can be used to read input while solving
problems. The first example shows how these elements can be applied to
subproblem 1 of the bouncing ball problem, and the second example
introduces and solves a new problem.

.Command line input
====

Subproblem 1 requires us to get the height, coefficient of restitution,
and number of bounces from the user. <<GetInputCLIProgram>>
shows a Java program to solve this subproblem.

.A Java program to get the height, coefficient of restitution, and number of bounces from the command line.
[source, java]
[[GetInputCLIProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/GetInputCLI.java[]
----
<1> Unlike our earlier example, the first line of `GetInputCLI.java` is
`import java.util.\*;`. Instead of importing only the `Scanner` class,
this line imports all the classes in the `java.util` package. The
asterisk (`*`) is known as a _wildcard_. The wildcard notation is
convenient if you need to import several classes from a package or if
you don't know in advance the names of all the classes you'll need.
<2> The class declaration names the class `GetInputCLI`. We put a `CLI` at the end of the name to mark that
it uses the command line interface, contrasting with the GUI version that we're going to show next.
<3> Inside the class declaration is the
definition of the `main()` method, showing where the program starts. The text that comes after double slashes (`//`) is called a _comment_. Comments allow us to make our code more readable to humans, but the
compiler ignores them.
<4> After the comments, we declare and instantiate a `Scanner` variable called `in` for reading from the keyboard.
<5> Next, we declare two `double`
variables (for holding double precision floating-point numbers) and an
`int` variable (for holding an integer value).
<6> We print out the name of the problem and then print out `"Enter the height: "`.
<7> The line `height = in.nextDouble();` tries to read in the height from the user. It waits until the user hits enter before reading the value and moving on to the next line. 
<8> The last four lines of the program prompt and read
in the coefficient of restitution and then the number of bounces. If you
compile and run this program, the execution should match the steps
described. Note that it only reads in the values needed to solve the
problem. We haven't added the code to compute the answer or display it.

[[inputForDistanceComputationExample]]
.Input for distance computation
====

Let's write a program that takes as input the speed of a moving object
and the time it's been moving. The goal is to compute and display the
total distance it travels. We can divide this problem into the following
three subproblems.

Subproblem 1:::
  Input speed and duration.
Subproblem 2:::
  Compute distance traveled.
Subproblem 3:::
  Display the computed distance.

<<DistanceProgram>> solves each of these subproblems in order,
using the command-line input and output tools we have just discussed.


.Computes the distance a moving object travels.
[source, java]
[[DistanceProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Distance.java[]
----
<1> The program starts with import statements, the class definition, and the
definition of the `main()` method.
<2> At the beginning of the `main()`
method, we have code to declare and initialize a variable of type
`Scanner` named `in`. We also declare variables of type `double` to hold
the input speed and time and the resulting distance.
<3> We start solving subproblem 1, prompting the user for the speed and the time and using our `Scanner` object to read them in. Because they are both floating-point values with type `double`, we use the `nextDouble()` method for input.
<4> We compute the distance traveled by multiplying `speed` by `time` and storing the result in
`distance`.
<5> The last three lines of the `main()` method solve subproblem 3 by outputting `"Distance traveled: "`, the computed distance, and `" miles."`. If you run the program, all three items are printed on the same line on the terminal.
====

==== GUI input and output

If you're used to GUI-based programs, you might wonder how to do input
and output with a GUI instead of on the command line. GUIs can become
complex, but in this chapter we introduce a  simple way
to do GUI input and output and expand on it further in
<<ch07-gui-basics#ch07-gui-basics>>. Then, we go into
GUIs in much more depth in <<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>>.

A limited tool for displaying output and reading input with a GUI is the
`JOptionPane` class. This class has a complicated method called
`showMessageDialog()` that opens a small _dialog box_ to display a
message to the user. If we want to create the equivalent of the
command-line program that displays the number 42, the code would be as
follows.

[source, java]
----
import javax.swing.JOptionPane; // <1>

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "42", "Output Example", // <2>
            JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
	}
}
----
<1> Like `Scanner`, we need to import `JOptionPane` as shown above in order
to use it.
<2> The `showMessageDialog()` method takes several arguments to
tell it what to do. For our purposes, the first one is always the
special Java literal `null`, which represents an empty value. The next
is the message you want to display, but it has to be text. That's why
`"42"` appears with quotation marks. The third argument is the title
that appears at the top of the dialog. The final argument gives
information about how the dialog should be presented.
`JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE` is a flag values that specifies that
the dialog is giving information (instead of a warning or a question),
causing an appropriate, system-specific icon to be displayed on the
dialog.

<<showMessageDialogFigure>> shows what the resulting GUI might look like.


[[showMessageDialogFigure]]
[.text-center]
.Example of `showMessageDialog()` used for output.
image::showMessageDialog.png[align=text-center,width=45%]

One way to do input with a GUI uses the `showInputDialog()` method,
which is also inside the `JOptionPane` class. The `showInputDialog()`
method _returns_ a value. This means it gives back an answer which
you can store into a variable by putting the method call on the right
hand side of an assignment statement. Otherwise, it's nearly the same
as `showMessageDialog()`. The following program prompts the user for his
or her favorite word with a `showInputDialog()` method and then displays
it again using a `showMessageDialog()` method.

[source, java]
----
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "What is your favorite word?";
        String title = "Input Example";
        String word =
        JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, message, title, JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE);
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, word, title, JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
    }
}
----

Note that whatever the user typed in will be stored in `word`. Finally,
the last line of the program displays this information with
`showMessageDialog()`. <<showInputDialogFigure>> shows the
GUI as the user is entering input.

[[showInputDialogFigure]]
[.text-center]
.Example of `showInputDialog()` used for input.
image::showInputDialog.png[align=text-center,width=45%]

Remember that the value returned from the `showInputDialog()` method is
always text; that is, it always has type `String`. Although there are
lots of great things you can do with a `String` value, you can't do
normal arithmetic like you can with an integer or a floating-point
number. However, there are ways to convert a `String` representation of
a number to the number itself. If you have a `String` that represents an
integer, you use the `Integer.parseInt()` method to convert it. If you
have a `String` that represents a floating-point number, you use the
`Double.parseDouble()` method to convert it. The following segment of
code illustrates these issues.

[source, java]
----
// Text cannot be multiplied by an integer
int x = "41" * 3;

// Correctly converts the text "23" to the integer 23
int y = Integer.parseInt("23");

// Correctly converts the text "3.14159" to 3.14159
double z = Double.parseDouble("3.14159");

// Causes the program to crash
int a = Integer.parseInt("Twenty three");

// Causes the program to crash
double b = Double.parseDouble("pi");
----

You might wonder why the computer isn't smart enough to know that `"23"`
means `23`. Remember, the computer has no intelligence. If something is
marked as text, it doesn't know that it can interpret it as a number.
What kind of data something is depends on its type, which doesn't
change. We'll discuss types more deeply in <<ch03-strings-primitive-types#ch03-strings-primitive-types>>.

The next example uses these two type conversion methods with methods
from `JOptionPane` in a GUI-based solution to subproblem 1 of the
bouncing ball problem.

.GUI input
====

We can change the solution given in <<GetInputCLIProgram>> to
use the GUI-based input tools in `JOptionPane`.
<<GetInputGUIProgram>> is the equivalent GUI-based Java program.

.Gets the height, coefficient of restitution, and number of bounces using a GUI.
[source, java]
[[GetInputGUIProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/GetInputGUI.java[]
----
<1> At this point the code uses the `showInputDialog()` method to read a `String` version of the height from the user.
<2> On the next line, we have to
convert this `String` version into the `double` version that we store in
the `height` variable.
<3> The next four lines read in the coefficient of
restitution and the number of bounces and convert them to their
appropriate numerical types.
====

==== A few operations

===== Basic math

To make our code useful, we can perform operations on values and
variables. For example, we used the expression `35 + 7` as an argument
to the `System.out.print()` method to print `42` to the screen. We can
use the add (`+`), subtract (`-`), multiply (`*`), and divide(`/`)
operators on numbers to solve arithmetic problems. These operators work
the way you'd expect them to (except that division has a few surprises).
We'll go into these operators and others more deeply in
<<ch03-strings-primitive-types#ch03-strings-primitive-types>>. Here are examples of
these four operators used with integer and floating-point numbers.

[source, java]
----
int a = 2 + 3;         // a will hold 5
int b = 2 - 3;         // b will hold -1
int c = 2 * 3;         // c will hold 6
int d = 2 / 3;         // d will hold 0 (explained later)

double x = 1.6 + 3.2;  // x will hold 4.8
double y = 1.6 - 3.2;  // y will hold -1.6
double z = 1.6 * 3.2;  // z will hold 5.12
double w = 1.6 / 3.2;  // w will hold 0.5
----

===== Other operations

These basic operations can mix values and variables together. As we'll
discuss later, they can be arbitrarily complicated with order of
operations determining the final answer. Nevertheless, we also need ways
to accomplish other mathematical operations such as raising a number to
a power or finding its square root. The `Math` class has methods that
perform these and other functions. To raise a number to a power, we call
`Math.pow()` with two arguments: first the base and then the exponent.
To find a square root, we pass a number to the `Math.sqrt()` method.

[source, java]
----
// Raises 3.0 to the power 2.5, approximately 15.588457
double p = Math.pow(3.0, 2.5);

// Finds the square root of 2.0, approximately 1.4142136
double q = Math.sqrt(2.0);
----

.Compute height
====

We compute the final height of the ball in subproblem 2 of the bouncing
ball problem. To do so, we have to multiply the height by the
coefficient of restitution raised to the power of the number of bounces.
The following program does so, using the `Math.pow()` method.

.Computes height of a ball after bounces.
[source, java]
[[ComputeHeightProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/ComputeHeight.java[]
----

<<ComputeHeightProgram>> is only focusing on subproblem 2, but,
if we want to test it, we need to supply some dummy values for `height`,
`coefficient`, and `bounces`, since these are read in by the solution to
subproblem 1. Likewise, the output statement on the last line of the
`main()` method is just for testing purposes. The complete solution has
more complex output.

====

===== `String` concatenation

Just as we can add numbers together, we can also "`add`" pieces of text
together. In Java, text has the type `String`. If you use the `+`
operator between two values or variables of type `String`, the result is
a new `String` that is the _concatenation_ of the two previous `String`
values, meaning that the result is the two pieces of text pasted
together, one after the other. Concatenation doesn't change the `String`
values you're concatenating.

The results may be illegal or at least unexpected if you mix types (`String`, `int`,
`double`) together when doing mathematical operations. However, feel
free to concatenate `String` values with any other type using the `+`
operator. When you do so, the other type is automatically converted into
a `String`. This behavior is useful since any `String` is easy to
output. Here are a few examples of `String` concatenation.

[source, java]
----
String word1 = "tomato";
String word2 = "sauce";
String text1 = word1 + word2; 			// text1 contains "tomatosauce"
String text2 = word1 + " " + word2; 	// text2 contains "tomato sauce"
String text3 = "potato " + word1;		// text3 contains "potato tomato"
String text4 = 5 + " " + word1 + "es"; 	// text4 contains "5 tomatoes"
----

.Display height
====

With `String` concatenation, subproblem 3 becomes a bit easier. We
concatenate the results together with an appropriate message and then
use the `System.out.println()` method for output.

.Displays height of a ball using the command line.
[source, java]
[[DisplayHeightCLIProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/DisplayHeightCLI.java[]
----

<<DisplayHeightCLIProgram>> is only focusing on subproblem 3,
but if we want to test it, we need to supply dummy values for `bounces`
and `bounceHeight`, since these are generated by the solution to earlier
subproblems.

The same concatenation can be used for GUI output as well. The only
difference is the use of +
`JOptionPane.showMessageDialog()` instead of `System.out.println()`.

==== Java formatting

Writing good Java code has some similarities to writing effectively in
English. There are rules you have to follow in order to make sense, but
there are also guidelines you should follow to make your
code easier to read for yourself and everyone else.

===== Variable and class naming

Java programs are filled with variables, and each variable should be
named to reflect its contents. Variable names are essentially unlimited
in length (although the JVM you use may limit this length to thousands
of characters). A tremendously long variable name can be hard to read,
but abbreviations can be worse. You want the meaning of your code to be
obvious to others and to yourself when you come back days or weeks
later.

Imagine you're writing a program that sells fruit. Consider the
following names for a variable that keeps track of the number of apples.

[.center%autowidth,cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Attributes
|`a` |Too short, gives no useful information

|`apps` |Too short, vague, could mean applications or appetizers

|`cntr` |Too short, vague, could mean center

|`counter` |Not bad, but counting what?

|`theVariableUsedToCountApples` |Too long for no good reason

|`appleCounter` |Very clear

|`apples` |Concise and clear, unless there are multiple apple quantities
such as `applesSold` and `applesBought`
|=======================================================================

Mathematics is filled with one letter variables, partly because there's
a history of writing mathematics on chalkboards and paper. Clarity is
more important than brevity with variables in computer programs. Some
variables need more than one word to be descriptive. In that case,
programmers of Java are encouraged to follow _camel case_. In camel
case, multi-word variables and methods start with a lowercase letter and
then use an uppercase letter to mark the beginning of each new word. It's
called camel case because the uppercase letters are reminiscent of
the humps of a camel. Examples include `lastValue`, `symbolTable`, and
`makeHamSandwich()`.

By convention, class names should always begin with a capital letter,
but they also use camel case, marking the beginning of
each new word with an uppercase letter. Examples include `LinkedList`, `JazzPiano`, and
`GlobalNuclearWarfare`.

Another convention is that constants, variables whose values never
change, have names in all uppercase, separated by underscores. Examples
include `PI`, `TRIANGLE_SIDES`, and
`UNIVERSAL_GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT`.

Spaces are not allowed in variable, method, or class names. Recall that
a name in Java is called an identifier. The rules for identifiers
specify that they must start with an uppercase or lowercase letter (or
an underscore) and that the remaining characters must be letters,
underscores, or numerical digits. Thus, `Tupac` and 
the absurd `_____5` are legal identifiers, but `Motley Crue` and
`2Pac` are not.

In Java, _letters_ can mean more than just the Latin letters A through Z. 
Java has support for many of the world's languages,
allowing identifiers to contain characters from Chinese, Thai,
Devanagari, Cyrillic, and other scripts.  For example, `m\u00F6tleyCr\u00FCe`
is a legal variable name because `\u00F6` is way of encoding `Ã¶` and
`\u00FC` is a way of encoding `Ã¼`.  In some systems, this variable name might
be rendered `mÃ¶tleyCrÃ¼e`, but the compiler could complain if you type those characters in directly.  In short, Java supports a huge range of
characters, but making that support work for you is sometimes more challenging.
<<Characters: `char`>> discusses character encoding further.

Remember that keywords also cannot be used as identifiers. For example,
`public`, `static`, and `class` are all keywords in Java and can never
be the names of classes, variables, or methods.

===== White space

Although you are not allowed to have spaces in a Java identifier, you
can usually use white space (spaces, tabs, and new lines) wherever you
want. Java ignores extra space. Consider the following line of code.

[source, java]
----
int x = y + 5;
----

It's equivalent to the next one.

[source, java]
----
int x=y+5;
----

We chose to type our earlier example of a program performing output as
follows.

[source, java]
----
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(42);
    }
}
----

However, we could have been more chaotic with our use of whitespace.

[source, java]
----
        public
class          Example {
public
    static void
    main (String     [
        ] args
        ) {
            System.
    out
        .print(42

) ; } }
----

Or we could have used almost no whitespace at all.

[source, java]
----
public class Example{public static void main(String[]args){System.out.print(42);}}
----

These three programs are identical in the eyes of the Java compiler, but
the first one is easier for a human to read. You should use whitespace
to increase readability. Don't add too much whitespace with lots of
blank lines between sections of code. On the other hand, don't use too
little and cramp the code together. Whenever code is nested inside of a
set of braces, indent the contents so that it's easy to see the
hierarchical relationship.

The style we present in this book puts the left brace (`{`) on the line
starting a block of code. Another popular style puts the left brace on
the next line. Here is the same example program formatted in this style:

[source, java]
----
public class Example
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.print(42);
    }
}
----

There are people (including some authors of this book) who prefer this
style because it's easier to see where blocks of code begin and end.
However, the other style uses less space, so we use it throughout
the book. You can make your own choices about style, but be consistent!
If you work for a software development company, they may have strict
standards for code formatting.

===== Comments

As we mentioned before, you can leave comments in your code whenever you
want someone reading the code to have extra information. Java has three
different kinds of comments. We described single-line comments, which
start with a `//` and continue until the end of the line.

If you have a large block of text you want as a comment, you can create
a block comment, which starts with a `/\*` and continues until it reaches
a `*/`.

Beyond leaving messages for other programmers, you can also "`comment
out`" existing code. By putting Java code inside a comment, it no longer affects
program execution. This practice is common when programmers
want to remove or change some code but are reluctant to delete it until
the new version of the code has been tested.  Don't overuse the practice
of commenting out code!  Large programs become hard to navigate when
they're cluttered with many chunks of commented-out code.

The third kind of comment is called a documentation comment and
superficially looks a lot like a block comment. A documentation comment
starts with a `/\**` and ends with a `*/`. These comments are supposed to
come at the beginning of classes and methods and explain what they're
used for and how to use them. A tool called `javadoc` is used to run
through documentation comments and generate an HTML file that users can
read to understand how to use the code. This tool is a feature
that has contributed greatly to the popularity of Java, keeping its
libraries well-documented and easy to use. However, we do not
discuss documentation comments deeply in this book.

Here is our example output program, heavily commented.

[source, java]
----
/**
 *  Class Example prints the number 42 to the screen.
 *  It contains an executable main() method.
 */
public class Example {
    /*
     * The main() method was last updated by Barry Wittman.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(42);  // answer to everything
    }
}
----

Comments are a wonderful tool, but clean code with meaningful variable
names and careful use of whitespace doesn't require too much commenting.
Never hesitate to comment, but always ask yourself if there is a way to
write the code so clearly that a comment is unnecessary.

=== Solution: How to solve problems

The problem solving steps given in <<Concepts: Developing software>> are sound, but they depend on being able to implement your
planned solution in Java. In this chapter we have introduced far too little Java
to expect to solve *all* the problems that can be solved with a computer. However, we can show the solution to the bouncing ball
problem and explain how our solution works through the software
development lifecycle.

==== Bouncing ball solution (command line version)

In <<ballBouncingProblemExample>>, we made sure
we understood the problem and then formed a three-part plan to read in
the input, compute the height of the bounce, and then output it.

In <<GetInputCLIProgram>>, we implemented subproblem 1, reading
the input from the command line. In <<ComputeHeightProgram>>,
we implemented subproblem 2, computing the height of the final bounce.
In <<DisplayHeightCLIProgram>>, we implemented subproblem 3,
displaying the height that was computed. In the final, integrated
program, the portion of the code that corresponds to solving subproblem
1 is below.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/BouncingBallCLI.java[lines=1..22]
----

With the imports, class declaration, and `main()` method set up by the
solution to subproblem 1, the solution to subproblem 2 is very short.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/BouncingBallCLI.java[lines=24..25]
----

The solution to subproblem 3 and the braces that mark the end of the
`main()` method and then the end of the class only take up a few
more lines.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/BouncingBallCLI.java[lines=27..32]
----


==== Bouncing ball solution (GUI version)

If you prefer a GUI for your input and output, we can integrate the
GUI-based versions of the solutions to subproblems 1, 2, and 3 from
<<GetInputCLIProgram>>, <<ComputeHeightProgram>>, and
<<DisplayHeightGUIProgram>>. The final program is below. It only
differs from the command line version in a few details.

.Full program to compute the height of the final bounce of a ball and display the result with a GUI.

----

==== Testing and maintenance

Testing and maintenance are key elements of the software engineering
lifecycle and often take more time and resources than the rest. However,
we only discuss them briefly here.

The ball bouncing problem is not complex. There are a few obvious things
to test. We should pick a "`normal`" test case such as a height of 15
units, a coefficient of restitution of 0.3, and 10 bounces. The height
should be 15 â 0.3^10^ = 0.0000885735. The result
computed by our program should be the same, ignoring floating-point
error. We can also check some boundary test cases. If the coefficient of
restitution is 1, the ball should bounce back perfectly, reaching
whatever height we input. If the coefficient of restitution is 0, the
ball doesn't bounce at all, and the final height should be 0.

Our code does not account for users entering badly formatted data like
`two` instead of `2`. Likewise, our code does not detect invalid values
such as a coefficient of restitution greater than 1 or a negative number
of bounces. An industrial-grade program should. We'll discuss testing
further in <<ch16-testing-and-debugging#ch16-testing-and-debugging>>.

As with most of the problems we discuss in this book, issues of
maintenance will not apply: we don't have a customer base to keep happy.
Even so, it's a good thought exercise to imagine a large-scale version
of this program that can solve many different kinds of physics problems.
Who are likely to be your clients? What kinds of bugs are
likely to creep into such a program? How would you provide bug-fixes and
develop new features?

=== Concurrency: Solving problems in parallel

==== Parallelism and concurrency

The terms _parallelism_ and _concurrency_ are often confused and
sometimes used interchangeably. Parallelism or parallel computing occurs
when multiple computations are being performed at the same time.
Concurrency occurs when multiple computations may interact with each
other. The distinction is subtle since many parallel computations are
concurrent and vice versa.

An example of parallelism without concurrency is two separate programs
running on a multicore system. They are both performing computations at
the same time, but for the most part, they aren't interacting with
each other. Concurrency issues might arise if these programs try to
access a shared resource, such as a file, at the same time.

An example of concurrency without parallelism is a program with multiple
threads of execution running on a single-core system. These threads will
not execute at the same time as each other. However, the OS or run-time
system will interleave the execution of these threads, switching back
and forth between them whenever it wants to. Since these threads can
share memory, they can still interact with each other in complicated and
often unpredictable ways.

With multicore computers, we want good and effective parallelism,
computing many things at the same time. Unfortunately, striving to reach
parallelism often means struggling with concurrency and carefully
managing the interactions between threads.

==== Sequential versus concurrent programming

Imagine that the evil Lellarap aliens are attacking Earth. They have
sent an extensive list of demands to the world's leaders, but only a few
people, including you, have mastered their language, Lellarapian. To
save the people of Earth, it's imperative that you translate their
demands as quickly as possible so world leaders can choose
a course of action. If you do it alone, as illustrated in
<<documentTranslationFigure>>(a), the Lellaraps might attack
before you finish.

In order to finish the work faster, you hire a second translator whose
skills in Lellarap are as good as yours. As shown in
<<documentTranslationFigure>>(b), you divide the document into
two nearly equal parts, Document A and Document B. You translate
Document A, and your colleague translates Document B. When both
translations are complete, you merge the two, check the translation, and
send the result to the world's leaders.

[[documentTranslationFigure]]
.(a)Â Translation by one translator. Time _t_~_s_~ gives the sequential time taken. (b)Â Translation by translators A and B. Times _t_~1~, _t_~2~, _t_~3~, and _t_~4~ give the times needed to do each component of the concurrent approach.
image::documentTranslationFigure.svg[scaledwidth=100%,pdfwidth=100%,width=100%]

Translating the demands alone is a _sequential_ approach. In this
context, sequential mean non-parallel. Translating the demands with two
people is a parallel approach. It's concurrent as well because you have
to decide how to split up the document and how to merge it back
together.

If you wrote a computer program to translate the demands using
the sequential approach, you'd produce a _sequential program_. If
you wrote a computer program that uses the approach shown in
<<documentTranslationFigure>>(b), it would be a _concurrent
program_. A concurrent program is also referred to as a _multi-threaded_
program. _Threads_ are sequences of code that can execute independently
and access each other's memory. Imagine you're one thread of execution
and your colleague is another. Thus, the concurrent approach will have
at least two threads. It may have more if separate threads are used to
divide up the document or merge it back together.

Because we're interested in the time the process takes, we've labeled
different tasks in <<documentTranslationFigure>> with their
running times. We let _t_~_s_~ be the time for one person to
complete the translation. The times _t_~1~ through
_t_~4~ mark the times needed to complete tasks 1 through 4,
indicated in <<documentTranslationFigure>>(b).

==== Kinds of concurrency

A sequential program, like the single translator, uses a single
processor on a multi-processor system or a single core on a multicore
chip. To speed up the solution of a program on a multicore chip, it may
be necessary to divide a problem so that different parts of it can be
executed concurrently.

This process of dividing up a problem falls into the category of _domain
decomposition_, _task decomposition_, or some combination of the two. In
domain decomposition, we take a large amount of data or elements to be
processed and divide up the data among workers that all do the same
thing to different parts of the data. In task decomposition, each worker
is assigned a different task that needs to be done. The following two
examples explore each of these approaches.

[[domainDecompositionExample]]
.Domain decomposition
====

Suppose we have an autonomous robot called the Room Rating Robot or
R^3^. The R^3^ can measure the area of any home. Suppose that we want to
use an R^3^ to measure the area of the home with two floors sketched in
<<figure-floorPlan>>.

[[figure-floorPlan]]
[.text-center]
.A home with two floors.
image::floorPlan.svg[scaledwidth=60%,pdfwidth=60%,width=60%]


One way to measure the area is to put an R^3^ at the entrance of the
home on the first floor and give it the following instructions:

1.  Initialize total area to 0
2.  Find area of next room and add to total area
3.  Repeat Step 2 until all rooms have been measured
4.  Move to second floor
5.  Repeat Step 2 until all rooms have been measured
6.  Display total area

By following these steps, the R^3^ will systematically go through each
room, measure its area, and add the value to the total area found so
far. It'll then climb up the stairs and repeat the process for the
second floor. It would add up the areas from the two floors and give
us the total living area of the house. This is a sequential approach for
measuring the area.

Now, suppose we have two R^3^ robots, named R^3^A and R^3^B. We can put
R^3^A on the first floor and R^3^B on the second. Both robots are then
instructed to find the area of the floor they're on using steps very
similar to the ones listed above for a sequential solution. When done,
we add together the answers from R^3^A and R^3^B to get the total. This
is a concurrent (and also parallel) approach for measuring the living
area of a home with two floors. Using two robots this way could speed
up the time it takes to measure the area.

====


****
<<domainDecompositionRobotsExercise>>
****


In the example above, the tasks are the same (measuring the area)
but are performed on two different input domains (the floors).
This type of task division is also known as domain
decomposition. Here, to achieve concurrency, we take the domain of the
problem (the house) and divide it into smaller subdomains (its floors).
Then, each processor (or robot in this example) performs the same task
on each subdomain. When done, the final answer is found by combining the
answers. Running the robots on each floor is purely parallel, but
combining the answers is concurrent since some interaction between the
robots is necessary.

****
<<domainDecompositionConcurrentExercise>>
****

Another way of solving a problem concurrently is to divide it into
fundamentally different tasks. The tasks could be executed on different
processors and perhaps on different input domains. Eventually, some
coordination of the tasks must be done to generate the final result. The
next example illustrates such a division.

.Task decomposition
====

Let's expand the problem given in <<domainDecompositionExample>>. R^3^ robots can do more than just measure area. In
addition to calculating the living area of a home, we want an R^3^ robot
to check if the electrical outlets are in working condition. The robot
should give us the area of the house as well as a list of electrical
outlets that are not working.

This problem can be solved in a sequential manner with just one robot.
One way to do so would have a robot make a first pass through all
floors and rooms and compute the living area. It could then make a second
pass and compile a list of electrical outlets that are not working.

A way to solve this problem concurrently is to assign R^3^A to measure
the area and R^3^B to identify broken electrical outlets. Once the
respective tasks are assigned, we place the robots at the entrance to
the house and activate them. It's possible that the two robots will
bump into each other while working, and that's one of the difficulties
of concurrency. The burden is on the programmer to give instructions so
that the robots can avoid or recover from collisions. After the robots
are done, we ask R^3^A for the living area of the house and R^3^B for a
list of broken outlets.

=== Summary

In this chapter, we introduced an approach for developing software to
solve problems with a computer. A number of examples illustrated how to
move from a problem statement to a complete Java program. Although we
have given rough explanations of the Java programs in this chapter,
we encourage you to play with each program to expand its functionality.
Several exercises prompt you to do just that. It's impossible to learn
to program without actively practicing programming. Never be afraid of
"`breaking`" the program. Only by breaking it, changing it, and fixing
it will your understanding grow.

In addition to the software development lifecycle, we introduced several
building blocks of Java syntax including classes, `main()` methods,
import statements, and variable declarations. We also gave a preview of
different variable types (`int`, `double`, and `String`) and operations
that can be used with them. Material about types and operations on them
is covered in depth in the next chapter. Furthermore, we discussed input
and output using `Scanner` and `System.out.print()` for the command line
interface and `JOptionPane` methods for a GUI.

Finally, we introduced the notions of sequential and concurrent
solutions to problems and clarified the subtle difference between
parallelism and concurrency.

=== Exercises

computer, what problem is solved by the programmer and what problem is
solved by the program written by the programmer? Are they the same?

`double`. How would the program behave differently if we had declared
all the variables with type `int`?

statement from <<BouncingBallGUIProgram>> a declaration, an assignment, or a
combination of the two?

String response = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,
	message, title, JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE);
----
.  When would you
prefer using the `JOptionPane` class for output over
`System.out.print()`? When might you prefer `System.out.print()` to
using `JOptionPane`?
.  [[javaKeywordsExercise]] Review
<<BouncingBallGUIProgram>> and identify all the Java keywords
used in it.
.  [[importExercise]] Try to recompile
<<BouncingBallGUIProgram>> after removing the `import`
statement at the top. Read and explain the error message generated by
the compiler.
.  Explain the difference
between parallel and concurrent tasks. Give examples of tasks that are
parallel but not concurrent, tasks that are concurrent but not parallel,
and tasks that are both.
. [[parallelTimeExercise]] Refer to
<<documentTranslationFigure>>. Suppose that you and your
colleague translate from English to Lellarapian at the rate of 200 words
per hour. Suppose that the list of demands contains 10,000 words.
..  Compute _t_~_s_~, the time for you to translate the entire
document alone, assuming that, after translation, you perform a final
check at the rate of 500 words per hour.
..  Now assume that the task of splitting up the document and handing
over the correct part to your colleague takes 15 minutes. Also, the task
of receiving the translated document from your colleague and merging
with the one you translated takes another 15 minutes. After merging the
two documents, you do a final check for correctness at a rate of 500
words per hour. Calculate the total time to complete the translation
using this concurrent approach. Let us refer to this time as
_t_~_c_~.
..  One way to calculate the speedup of a concurrent solution is to
divide the sequential time by the concurrent time. In our case, the
speedup is _t_~_s_~/_t_~_c_~. Using the values you've computed in
(a) and (b), calculate the speedup.
..  Suppose that you have a total of two colleagues willing to help you
with the translation. Assuming that the three of you will perform the
translation and that the times needed to split, merge, and check are
unchanged, calculate the total time needed. Then, compute the speedup.
..  Now suppose that there are an unlimited number of people willing and
able to help you with the translation. Will the speedup keep on
increasing as you add more translators? Explain your answer.

of a single-floor home. Suggest how two robots could be programmed to
work concurrently to measure the living area faster than one.

*Programming Practice*

. [[integerSumExercise]] Write a program that prompts the user
for three integers from the command line. Read each integer in using the
`nextInt()` method of a `Scanner` object. Compute the sum of these
values and print it to the screen using `System.out.print()` or
`System.out.println()`.
. [[integerAverageExercise]] Expand the program from
<<integerSumExercise>> so that it finds the average of
the three numbers instead of the sum. (Hint: Try dividing by `3.0`
instead of `3` to get an average with a fractional part. Then, store the
result in a variable of type `double`.)
. Rewrite your solution to <<integerAverageExercise>> so
that it uses a `JOptionPane`-based GUI instead of `Scanner` and
`System.out.print()`.
. [[runCLIProgramExercise]] Copy and paste
<<GetInputCLIProgram>> into the Java IDE you prefer. Compile
and run it and make sure that the program executes as intended. Then,
add statements to prompt the user for the color of the ball and read it
in. Store the color in a `String` value. Add an output statement that
mentions the color of the ball.
. Rewrite your solution to <<runCLIProgramExercise>>
so that it uses a `JOptionPane`-based GUI instead of `Scanner` and
`System.out.print()`.
. In <<inputForDistanceComputationExample>>, we assumed that the speed is given in miles
per hour and the time in hours. Change <<DistanceProgram>> to
compute the distance traveled by a moving object given its speed in
miles per hour but time in seconds. You will need to perform a
conversion from seconds to hours before you can find the distance.
. A program can use both a command
line interface and a GUI to interact with a user. Write a program that
uses the `Scanner` class to read a `String` value containing the user's
favorite food. Then display the name of the food using `JOptionPane`.
. Use the complete software development cycle to write a program that
reads in the lengths of two legs of a right triangle and computes the
length of its hypotenuse.
..  Make sure you understand the problem. How can you apply the
Pythagorean formula _a_^2^ + _b_^2^ = _c_^2^ to solve it?
..  Design a solution by listing the steps you will need to take to read
in the appropriate values, find the answer, and then output it.
..  Implement the steps as a Java program.
..  Test the solution with several known values. For example, a right
triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 has a hypotenuse of length 5.
Which values cause errors? How should your program react to those
errors?
..  Consider what other features your program should have. If your
intended audience is children who are learning geometry, should your
error handling be different from an audience of architects?
