=== Problem: Codon extractor

Recall from <<ch05-repetition#ch05-repetition>> that we can record DNA as a
sequence of nucleotide bases A, C, G, and T. Using this idea, we can
represent any sequence of DNA using a `String` made up of those four
letters such as `"ATGGAAGTATTTAAATAG"`.

This particular sequence contains 18 bases and six _codons_. A codon is
a three-base subsequence in DNA. Biologists are interested in dividing
DNA into codons because a single codon usually maps to the production of
a specific amino acid. Amino acids, in turn, are the building blocks of
proteins. The DNA sequence above contains the six codons ATG, GAA, GTA,
TTT, AAA, and TAG.

We want to write a program that extracts codons from DNA
sequences entered by the user. The program must detect and inform the
user of invalid DNA sequences (those containing letters other than the
four bases). If the user enters a DNA sequence whose length is not a
multiple of three, the final codon should be written with one or two
asterisks (`*`), representing the missing bases.

With your knowledge of `String` manipulation and loops, this problem
should be easy. However, we want to solve it with a _graphical user
interface_, not with the command line interaction we've emphasized in
previous chapters. That is, the input step should be done with a window
that looks similar to the following.

[[codonInput]]

And the corresponding output should look very much like this.

[[GUIBasicsIntroductionSection]]
=== Concepts: User interaction

Many computer programs communicate with a human user. There are at least
two ways in which this communication can happen. One way is to use
command line input and output. In this case, a program prompts the user
for an input and the user responds through the keyboard, usually
completing the response by pressing the `<return>` or `<enter>` key.
Another way to communicate is to use a graphical user interface or GUI.
(Some people pronounce "`GUI`" to sound like "`gooey,`" but others say
"`G-U-I.`") In this case, the program displays a window consisting of
one or more _widgets_, such as a button labeled "`OK`" or a text box in
which the user can type some text. Widgets (also known as controls) can
include buttons, labels, text areas, check boxes, menus, and many other
pre-defined objects for user interaction. While the program waits for
the user or does something in the background, the user has the option of
using a combination of the keyboard and the mouse to respond to the
program. While command line interfaces were dominant until the mid-70s,
GUIs have become the prime mode of communication between a program and a
human user. This chapter focuses on the design of simple GUIs using a
few built-in Java classes. <<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>> introduces more advanced tools for constructing complex
GUIs.

.User interaction
====
<<applicationInterfaceFigure>>(a) shows a Java application
interacting with a user through a command line interface. The
application asks the user for a temperature value in degrees Fahrenheit,
converts it to the equivalent Celsius, and displays it. <<applicationInterfaceFigure>>(b) shows a
similar application interacting with the user through a GUI. In this
case, the application creates a window with six widgets (two labels, two text boxes,
and two buttons). The user enters a temperature value in the text box
below either the Celsius label or the Fahrenheit label and presses
the appropriate Convert button. Then, the application displays the
equivalent temperature in the other text box.

image::applicationInterface.svg[scaledwidth=100%,pdfwidth=100%,width=100%]
====

We describe the GUIs we introduce in this chapter as simple because
several aspects of GUI creation are hidden by the methods we use.
For example, these GUIs do not require the programmer to handle the
details of events such as a user pressing an "`OK`" button or typing
text into a text box and pressing the `<enter>` key. These events will
be handled automatically by existing libraries.
<<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>> discusses the
creation of more complex GUIs that require the programmer to program
event handling explicitly.

=== Syntax: Dialogs and the `JOptionPane` class

`JOptionPane` is a utility class for creating GUIs consisting 
of a single dialog. It offers a variety of ways to create useful dialogs
quickly and easily and is part of the larger Java Swing GUI library. In
this chapter, we'll show you how to use the static methods and
constants in `JOptionPane` to construct useful dialogs. Specifically,
you'll learn how to construct the following four types of dialogs.

Information:::
  An information, or message, dialog displays a message to the user.
  Static method `showMessageDialog()` creates such a dialog. See
  <<simpleMessageFigure>> for an example of a message dialog.
Confirm:::
  A confirm dialog asks a user to confirm a statement. Static method +
  `showConfirmDialog()` creates such a dialog. This dialog may return
  user input as `YES_OPTION`, `NO_OPTION`, `OK_OPTION`, or
  `CANCEL_OPTION`. See <<yes-noDialogFigure>> for an example of
  a Yes-No dialog.
Option:::
  An option dialog asks the user to select one from an arbitrary set of
  options. Static method `showOptionDialog()` creates such a dialog. See
  <<selectCapitalDialogFigure>> for an example.
Input:::
  An input dialog is useful for obtaining data provided by the user.
  Static method `showInputDialog()` creates such a dialog. The user can
  input a `String` that might represent a number, a name, or any
  arbitrary text. See <<inputDialogFigure>> for an
  example.

The `JOptionPane` class can be used to create both _modal_ and
_non-modal_ dialogs. A modal dialog is one that forces the user to
interact with the dialog before the program can continue. Thus, the
dialog is dismissed and the program execution resumes only *after* the
user has responded. Modal dialogs are useful in situations where user
input is required for the program to continue.

A non-modal dialog is one that's displayed on the screen and doesn't
require the user to interact with it for the underlying program to
proceed. It's easy to create a modal dialog using the static methods in
the `JOptionPane` class mentioned earlier. Creation of non-modal dialogs
requires a bit more effort and is not covered in this chapter. In the
remainder of this chapter we show how to use `JOptionPane` to create
various types of modal dialogs.

[[informationMessageDialog]]
==== Generating an information dialog

Programs often need to generate a message for the user and request a
response. The message might be a short piece of information, and the
only response might be "`OK.`" Alternatively, the message might be more complex and
require a more thoughtful response. In this section, we show how the
Java utility class `JOptionPane` can generate a simple dialog whose sole
purpose is to inform the user that a task has been completed.

.Simple dialog
====
<<SimpleDialogProgram>> creates a dialog to inform the user
that the task it was assigned to perform is now complete.
<<simpleMessageFigure>> shows the dialog generated by this
program.


.Generates a simple dialog.
[source, java]
[[SimpleDialogProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/SimpleDialog.java[]
----
<1> We import classes used in this program. The `swing` package
contains a number of classes needed to create a GUI, and `JOptionPane`
is one such class.
<2> These lines use a static
method to create a modal dialog. `JOptionPane` is a utility class, and
`showMessageDialog()` is a static method in this class. This method,
along with the other three `JOptionPane` methods we discuss in this
chapter, is a _factory method_, meaning that it creates a new object (in
this case some kind of dialog object) on the fly with specific
attributes. In this example, the program informs the user that a
task has been completed. The method has the following four parameters.
+
Component:::
  The parent component in which the dialog is displayed. We use `null`
  in this example, which causes a default frame to be used, centering
  the dialog in the screen.
Message:::
  The message to be displayed. In this example, we have +
  `"Task completed. Click OK to exit."`
Title:::
  The title of the dialog. In this example, it is
  `"A Simple Dialog"`.
Message Type:::
  The type of the message to be displayed. In this example, we use the
  constant `INFORMATION_MESSAGE`.
Icon:::
  The icon to be displayed in the dialog. If you have an object of type
  `Icon`, you can use it to customize your dialog. The
  `showMessageDialog()` is an overloaded method that can take several
  different sets of parameters. In this example, we used a version of
  the method that does not specify an icon.
+
<3> We display a message on the terminal which isn't
needed in this program but illustrates an interesting point. When
you run `SimpleDialog`, you'll notice that the `"Done."` message
displays on the terminal only *after* you've clicked the "`OK`" button.
This modal behavior blocks execution of the thread that generated it until
the button is pressed.

In <<simpleMessageFigure>> the dialog titled "`Simple Dialog`"
includes an icon, a message, and a button labeled "`OK.`" This dialog is
actually a _frame_, which is what windows are called in Java. We'll
discuss frames in greater detail in <<Syntax: GUIs in Java>>.


[[simpleMessageFigure]]
[.text-center]
.A simple dialog generated using `JOptionPane`.
image::simpleMessageFigure.svg[scaledwidth=80%,pdfwidth=80%,width=80%]

The appearance of the dialog may be different on your
computer. Even though Java is platform independent, GUIs are customized
based on the OS you're running. Each OS has a default _look and feel_
(L & F) manager that specifies how widgets look and behave in your
program. You can change the L & F manager, but not all managers are
available on all operating systems.
====

In the previous example, we displayed a message of type
`INFORMATION_MESSAGE`. There are additional message types that could be
used.

* `ERROR_MESSAGE`
* `PLAIN_MESSAGE`
* `QUESTION_MESSAGE`
* `WARNING_MESSAGE`

When used as parameters in `showMessageDialog()`, the constants above
cause different default icons to be displayed in the dialog box.
<<iconsInMessageDialogsFigure>> shows dialogs generated by
`showMessageDialog()` when using `JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE`, (left)
and `JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE` (right). Note the difference in the
icons displayed toward the top left of the two dialogs.

[[iconsInMessageDialogsFigure]]
[.text-center]
.The left dialog uses `JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE`, and the right uses `JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE`. The only difference is the icon displayed.

[[yes-noDialog]]
==== Generating a Yes-No confirm dialog

There are situations when a program needs to obtain a binary answer from
the user, a "`yes`" or a "`no.`" The next example shows how to generate
such a dialog and how to get the user's response.


[[yes-NoDialogExample]]
.Yes-No dialog
====

Consider a program that checks whether a student understands the
difference between odd and even integers. The program generates a random
integer _x_, presents it to the user, and asks the question,
"`Is _x_ an odd integer?`" The answer given by the user is
checked for correctness, and the user is informed accordingly.
<<OddEvenTestProgram>> shows how to use the `JOptionPane` class
to generate a dialog for such an interaction.

.Tests knowledge of odd and even integers with a Yes-No dialog.
[source, java]
[[OddEvenTestProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/OddEvenTest.java[]
----
<1> We declare a random number generator named `random` and then use it to generate a random number from 0 to 9.
<2> We present the number to the user. Note
the use of `JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION` as the last parameter in the
`showConfirmDialog()`. The generated
dialog is shown in <<yes-noDialogFigure>>(a). The call to
`showConfirmDialog()` returns the
`JOptionPane.YES_OPTION` or the `JOptionPane.NO_OPTION` value
depending on whether the user clicked the "`Yes`" or "`No`" button.
<3> A second dialog is shown with a message dependent on whether the user gives the correct answer. The two different versions of this dialog are shown in <<yes-noDialogFigure>>(b) and (c).

[[yes-noDialogFigure]]
[.text-center]
.(a) A Yes-No dialog generated using `JOptionPane`. (b) Dialog in response to correct answer. (c) Dialog in response to incorrect answer.
image::yes-noDialogFigure.svg[scaledwidth=100%,pdfwidth=100%,width=100%]

====

Because we used `YES_NO_OPTION`, the dialog in
<<yes-NoDialogExample>> automatically generates two buttons
labeled "`Yes`" and "`No.`" Dialogs can also use the
`YES_NO_CANCEL_OPTION` to generate a dialog with "`Yes,`" "`No,`" and
"`Cancel`" options. The return value from `showConfirmDialog()` is
`CANCEL_OPTION` if the user presses the "`Cancel`" button.

==== Generating a dialog with a list of options

The `JOptionPane` class can also be used to generate an arbitrary set of
options as shown in the next example.

.Capital dialog
====

Consider a program that asks the user to select the correct capital of a
country from a list of capitals. It shows three options and asks
the user to select one from among the three. It then checks the user
response for correctness and displays a suitable message.

.Generates a dialog with programmer-defined options.
[source, java]
[[CapitalQuizProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/CapitalQuiz.java[]
----
<.> We call the `showOptionDialog()` method to create a dialog with multiple options. In our case, the options are three names of capitals, and only one of them is correct. <<selectCapitalDialogFigure>> shows the dialog created. +
The `showOptionDialog()` method creates an options dialog, which is the most complicated (but also the most flexible) of all the dialogs. The array of `String` values provided as the second to last parameter to `showOptionDialog()` gives the labels for the buttons. +
There are three `null` values passed into this method. The first one functions like the `null` used in <<OddEvenTestProgram>>, specifying that the default frame should be used. The second specifies that the default icon should be used. In the next section, we'll show how to specify a custom icon. The last parameter indicates the default button, which will have focus when the dialog is created. If the user hits `<enter>` instead of clicking, the button with focus is the button that will be pressed.
<.> As in <<OddEvenTestProgram>>, a second dialog is shown with a message dependent on whether the user gives the correct answer.

[[customIconDialog]]
==== Generating a dialog with a custom icon

A custom icon can be included in any dialog. Each of the methods in
`JOptionPane` introduced earlier can take an icon as a parameter. The
next example illustrates how to do so.

.Custom icon
====

<<CustomIconDialogProgram>> shows how to use
`showMessageDialog()` to generate a message dialog with a custom icon.

.Generates a dialog with a custom icon.
[source, java]
[[CustomIconDialogProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/CustomIconDialog.java[]
----
<1> The last parameter creates a new `ImageIcon` object from the `file` `String` (`"bat.png"` in this case). The resulting dialog appears in <<customIconDialogFigure>>.

Dialogs illustrated in earlier examples can also use an icon parameter to include a custom icon.

[[customIconDialogFigure]]
[.text-center]
.Dialog with a custom icon generated by <<CustomIconDialogProgram>>.
image::customIconDialogFigure.png[scaledwidth=50%,pdfwidth=50%,width=50%]

Note that the icon shown above will not appear when you run this code
unless you have a copy of `bat.png` in the appropriate directory.
====

==== Generating an input dialog

An input dialog can read text data from the user. The
`showInputDialog()` method in the `JOptionPane` class allows us to
create such a dialog. We introduced the `showInputDialog()` method in
<<Syntax: Java basics>>, but we give two more examples here to
emphasize its similarity to the other `JOptionPane` factory methods and
to show off some of its additional features.


[[inputDialogExample]]
.Input dialog
====

We want to write a program that asks a question about basic chemistry.
<<ChemistryQuizOneProgram>> shows how to display a question,
obtain an answer from the user, check for the correctness of the answer,
and report back to the user.

.Generates a dialog to input data as text.
[source, java]
[[ChemistryQuizOneProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/ChemistryQuizOne.java[]
----
<.> We use the `showInputDialog()` method to generate the dialog shown in <<inputDialogTextFigure>>. This method returns a `String` named `response` containing the text entered by the user in the dialog box.
<.> We convert this `String` to an `int` and save it into variable `answer`.
<.> We check this value against the correct answer.
<.> The `showMessageDialog()` method informs the user whether or not the answer is correct.

It's important to note that the user could type any sequence of
characters in the dialog box. Try running
<<ChemistryQuizOneProgram>> and see what happens when you type
"`two,`" instead of the number "`2,`" into the dialog box and press the
"`OK`" button. The program will generate an exception indicating that
the input `String` cannot be converted to an integer.

<<integerFormatExceptionExercise>>
****

[[inputDialogWithAListExample]]
.Input dialog with a list
====

In <<inputDialogExample>> the user is required to enter text. To reduce input errors, we can restrict the user to
picking from a predefined list. We can create this list by generating an
array and supplying it as a parameter to the `showInputDialog()` method.

<<ChemistryQuizTwoProgram>> displays a list of chemical
elements and asks the user to select the heaviest.

.Generates a dialog to input a choice from a list.
[source, java]
[[ChemistryQuizTwoProgram]]
----
include::{programsdir}/ChemistryQuizTwo.java[]
----
<.> We pass an array of four `String` values to the `showInputDialog()` method. Note that the last parameter to this method is `null` indicating that no specific item on the list should be selected by default. (In this case, the first item in the list is initially selected.) The generated dialog is shown in <<inputDialogListFigure>>. The four elements are contained in a drop-down list. +
Unlike <<inputDialogExample>>, the return value from `showInputDialog()` is now of type `Object`, not of type `String`. The type of the list required by the method is `Object` array. You're allowed to pass a `String` array to a method that wants an `Object` array due to inheritance, which is further discussed in
<<ch11-inheritance#ch11-inheritance>> and <<ch17-polymorphism#ch17-polymorphism>>. The return value is the specific object from the array that was passed in. In our case, it *has* to be a `String`, but the compiler isn't smart enough to figure that out. For this reason, we cast the object to a `String` before using the `equals()` method.
<.> We check this `String` for correctness.
<.> As before, the `showMessageDialog()` method informs the user whether or not the answer is correct.

[[inputDialogListFigure]]
[.text-center]
.Dialog to read input from a list generated by <<ChemistryQuizTwoProgram>>.
image::inputDialogListFigure.png[scaledwidth=50%,pdfwidth=50%,width=50%]

Note that this program will crash if the user clicks the "`Cancel`" button,
since `null` will be returned and stored into `response`.
====


.Input dialog with a long list
====

[[inputDialogListManyItemsFigure]]
[.text-center]
.A dialog requesting user to select one item from a list of 20 data items. Note the use of a scroll down list to display the items.
image::inputDialogListManyItemsFigure.png[scaledwidth=50%,pdfwidth=50%,width=50%]


When the number of elements in the list supplied to the
`showInputDialog()` is 20 or more, a `JList` object is automatically
used to display the items as shown in
<<inputDialogListManyItemsFigure>>.

Other than a longer list, the code in this example is virtually
identical to the code in <<ChemistryQuizTwoProgram>>.
====

=== Solution: Codon extractor

Here we give the solution to the codon extractor problem posed at the
beginning of the chapter. As we have done throughout this chapter, we
start with the import needed for GUIs built on the Swing framework. Next
we begin the `CodonExtractor` class and its `main()` method. For
readability, the solution to this problem is divided into methods that
each do a specific task. We hope that the way a method works is
intuitively clear to you. If not, the next chapter explains them in
detail.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/CodonExtractor.java[lines=1..19]
----
<.> The `main()` method contains a `do`-`while` loop that allows the user to
enter sequences repeatedly.
<.> The `showInputDialog()` method makes an
input dialog and returns the `String` the user enters.
<.> The `toUpperCase()` method converts the `String` to uppercase, allowing us to read input in either case.
<.> We then call the `isValid()` method to make sure that the user entered a
valid DNA sequence.
<.> If it is valid, we use `displayCodons()` to display
the codons in the sequence.
<.> Either way, we use a `showConfirmDialog()` method to creating a confirm dialog, asking the user if he or she wants to continue entering sequences. The loop will continue as long as the return value is `JOptionPane.YES_OPTION`.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/CodonExtractor.java[lines=21..29]
----

The `isValid()` method checks to see if the DNA contains only the
letters representing the four bases. To do this, we use the Java
`String` library cleverly: We loop through the characters in our input,
checking to see where they can be found in `"ACGT"`. If the index
returned is -1, the character was not found, and the DNA is invalid.

In the `displayCodons()` method, we display the individual codons to the
user.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/CodonExtractor.java[lines=31..46]
----
<.> We build a large `String` with newlines separating each codon. To do so, we loop through the input, jumping ahead three characters each time. If the input length is not a multiple of three, we pad with asterisks.
<.> We use the `showMessageDialog()` method to display an information dialog with the list of codons.

=== Concurrency: Simple GUIs

Many GUI frameworks (including Swing) are built on a multi-threaded
model. Swing uses threads to redraw widgets and listen for user input
while the main thread can continue processing other data.

In this chapter, the impact of these threads is minimal because we used
only *modal* dialogs. Every time we called a `JOptionPane` method, the
execution of the program's main thread had to wait until the method
returned. As it turns out, several threads are created when
`showInputDialog()` or any of the others dialog methods are called, but
they do not interact with the main thread since it's been blocked.

The situation is more complicated with a non-modal dialog, which is one
of the reasons we did not go into them. In a non-modal dialog, the
threads that redraw the dialog and handle its events (like a user
clicking on a button) are running at the same time as the thread that
created the dialog. Since many threads are running, it's possible for
them to write to the same data at the same time. Doing so can lead to
inconsistencies such as the ones we'll describe in
<<ch14-synchronization#ch14-synchronization>>.

The GUIs we'll create in <<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>>, however, will be more than dialogs. They will be fully
functional windows, known as frames in Java. Like a non-modal dialog,
the creation of a frame doesn't block the thread that created it.

Many applications launch a frame and then end their main thread. If no
other threads are created, such a program is comparatively easy to think about.
However, complex applications may create multiple frames or launch threads to work on
tasks in the background. Another common problem is caused by performing
complicated tasks in the event handler for a GUI. If a task takes too
long, the GUI can freeze or become unresponsive, as you've probably
experienced. The fact that this problem happens so frequently even in
the latest operating systems should hint at the difficulty of managing
GUI threads.

When we describe how to create fully featured GUIs in
<<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>>, we'll also
give some techniques to help with avoiding unresponsive GUIs in a
multi-threaded environment.

=== Summary

In this chapter we've introduced a way to create simple GUIs. These
GUIs are created using various methods available in the `JOptionPane`
class. While the interfaces created this way are limited in scope,
they're often adequate for input and output in short Java programs.
Construction of more complex GUIs is the subject of
<<ch15-gui#ch15-gui>>.

interface instead of a GUI? When is it better to use a GUI over a
command-line interface?

----
+
Which of these three implementations is best? Why?

*Programming Practice*

.  Modify the program in <<yes-NoDialogExample>> such that it
tests the user many times whether a randomly generated
integer is odd or even. The program should keep a score indicating the
number of correct answers. At the end of the test, display the score using a suitable dialog.
.  Modify the program in <<yes-NoDialogExample>> such that it
displays a dialog that asks the user "`Do you wish to continue?`" and
offers options "`Yes`" and "`No.`" The program should exit the loop when the
"`No`" option is selected and display the score using a suitable
dialog.
.  [[yesNoCancelExercise]] Rewrite
<<OddEvenTestProgram>> so that the dialog
generated offers the "`Yes,`" "`No,`" and "`Cancel`" options to the
user. The program should exit with a message dialog saying "`Thank You`" when
the user selects the "`Cancel`" option.
. [[capitalQuizExercise]] Modify
<<CapitalQuizProgram>> to create and administer a test wherein
the user is asked capitals of 10 countries in a sequence. The program
must keep a count of the number of correct answers.
Inform the user of the score at the end of the test using a suitable
dialog.
.  [[buttonFocusExercise]] Modify <<CapitalQuizProgram>> so that the button labeled "`Baku`" has focus when the program begins.
. [[shuffleCapitalsExercise]] <<Solution: Three card poker>> gives a method called `shuffle()` that can randomize an
array representing a deck of cards. Adapt this code and modify
<<CapitalQuizProgram>> so that the order of the capitals is
randomized. Note that you will need to record which index contains the
correct answer.
. Re-implement the solution to the college cost calculator problem
given in <<Solution: College cost calculator>> so that it uses
GUIs constructed with `JOptionPane` for input and output.
. Re-implement the solution to the Monty Hall problem given in
<<Solution: Monty Hall>> so that it uses GUIs constructed with
`JOptionPane` for input and output.
. Re-implement the solution to the DNA searching problem given in
<<Solution: DNA searching>> so that it uses GUIs constructed with
`JOptionPane` for input and output.
. Write a program that creates an input dialog that prompts and reads
a file name of an image from the user. Then, create an information
dialog that displays the file as a custom icon. In this way, you can
construct a simple image viewer.
. [[integerFormatExceptionExercise]] Use a `try`-`catch` block and modify
<<ChemistryQuizOneProgram>> so that it handles an exception
generated when the user enters text that cannot be converted to an
integer. In the event such an exception is raised, pop up a message
dialog box informing the user to try again and type an integer value.
When the user responds by clicking the "`OK`" button on this message
box, the input dialog box should appear once again and offer the user
another chance at the answer. Write two versions of the modified
program. In one version, your program should give only one chance for
input after an incorrect string has been typed. In another version, your
program should remain in a loop until the user enters a valid integer.
There is, of course, no guarantee that an answer is correct just because it's a valid integer.
+
*Note:* You should attempt this exercise only if you're familiar with exceptions in Java. Exceptions are covered in <<ch12-exceptions#ch12-exceptions>>.
